It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Freeman). While things start to pick up when the warden finds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker. However, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of them.\r\n\r\nThere was no fanfare or bunting put out for the release of the film back in 94, with a title that didn\'t give much inkling to anyone about what it was about, and with Columbia Pictures unsure how to market it, Shawshank Redemption barely registered at the box office. However, come Academy Award time the film received several nominations, and although it won none, it stirred up interest in the film for its home entertainment release. The rest, as they say, is history. For the film finally found an audience that saw the film propelled to almost mythical proportions as an endearing modern day classic. Something that has delighted its fans, whilst simultaneously baffling its detractors. One thing is for sure, though, is that which ever side of the Shawshank fence you sit on, the film continues to gather new fans and simply will never go away or loose that mythical status.\r\n\r\nIt\'s possibly the simplicity of it all that sends some haters of the film into cinematic spasms. The implausible plot and an apparent sentimental edge that makes a nonsense of prison life, are but two chief complaints from those that dislike the film with a passion. Yet when characters are this richly drawn, and so movingly performed, it strikes me as churlish to do down a human drama that\'s dealing in hope, friendship and faith. The sentimental aspect is indeed there, but that acts as a counterpoint to the suffering, degradation and shattering of the soul involving our protagonist. Cosy prison life you say? No chance. The need for human connection is never more needed than during incarceration, surely? And given the quite terrific performances of Robbins (never better) & Freeman (sublimely making it easy), it\'s the easiest thing in the world to warm to Andy and Red.\r\n\r\nThose in support aren\'t faring too bad either. Bob Gunton is coiled spring smarm as Warden Norton, James Whitmore is heart achingly great as the ""Birdman Of Shawshank,"" Clancy Brown is menacing as antagonist Capt. Byron Hadley, William Sadler amusing as Heywood & Mark Rolston is impressively vile as Bogs Diamond. Then there\'s Roger Deakins\' lush cinematography as the camera gracefully glides in and out of the prison offering almost ethereal hope to our characters (yes, they are ours). The music pings in conjunction with the emotional flow of the movie too. Thomas Newman\'s score is mostly piano based, dovetailing neatly with Andy\'s state of mind, while the excellently selected soundtrack ranges from the likes of Hank Williams to the gorgeous Le Nozze di Figaro by Mozart.\r\n\r\nIf you love Shawshank then it\'s a love that lasts a lifetime. Every viewing brings the same array of emotions - anger - revilement - happiness - sadness - inspiration and a warmth that can reduce the most hardened into misty eyed wonderment. Above all else, though, Shawshank offers hope - not just for characters in a movie - but for a better life and a better world for all of us. 10/10', 'Make way for the best film ever made people. **Make way.**', 'There is a reason why this movie is at the top of any popular list your will find.\r\nVery strong performances from lead actors and a story line from the literary brilliance of Stephen King (and no, its not a horror).\r\nSufficient drama and depth to keep you interested and occupied without stupefying your brain. It is the movie that has something for everyone.', 'It\'s still puzzling to me why this movie exactly continues to appear in every single best-movies-of-all-time chart.

This movie worth a rewatch by all means, but yet, there\'s no unique vibe or something - there are thousands of other ones as good as this one.', ""I will not say that the film is predictable, because it is not quite so, due to the fact that we only know Andy’s intentions at the end, and during the film, it is important to understand that there was not a hint of it, but let's not forget our guys who so imprudently localized it. I will not be the first, but the word 'redemption' is translated as 'redemption'.

They are souls and spirits that can only withstand so much brainwashing. \r\nAdd to that, the story plods along with really nothing new to add. It\'s a very formula movie.\r\nI won\'t say it is a ""bad movie"". Those are ones I give 1 or 2 out of 10.

The handsome ""new fish"" is initially the target of the ""sisters"" who would use him as they would like - but he fights back and gradually establishes a friendship with prison ""scrounger"" Morgan Freeman (""Red""). When he overhears the beastly prison guard captain bemoaning some tax problems, he, rather riskily, volunteers to help find a tax-free solution and is soon advising pretty much the whole place - including ""Warden Norton"" (Bob Gunton) on all things financial - some above board, some less so. The film is set over a period of over ten years, and depicts some of the most brutal aspects of prison life; but also some it\'s more hopeful. It deals with violence and desperation but also of bonding and lasting friendships and loyalties that long term close-confinement engender. Frank Darabont elicits the best from his three principals superbly, with added venom provided by guard captain Clancy Brown and humanity from prison librarian James Whitmore - one of the few who actually does make parole. The last half hour is up there with the best cinema has ever had to offer, and this - again on a big screen - is a must see adaptation of one of Stephen King\'s lesser known, but better, stories that delivers a redemption never, quite, anticipated by the prison service!', '**Watched it 32 times**\r\n\r\nCall me obsessed, but I have watched this movie 32 times (and counting) over the past 2 decades. One may wonder why? It is because every time I watch this movie, I learn something new from it. For example, despite being such a good friend of Red, Andy never shares his plan with him. This taught me that discipline and focus is vital for success.\r\n\r\nI can not praise enough the tight plot, direction, acting and everything. On my favorite movies list, this one certainly tops the chart.', 'Amazing movie', 'This movie is an absolute masterpiece, blending deep emotion and powerful storytelling. It follows the journey of a banker wrongfully imprisoned, whose enduring hope and resilience inspire everyone around him. His friendship with a fellow inmate is heartwarming and beautifully portrayed, capturing the essence of human connection. The film explores themes of redemption and the strength of the human spirit, leaving a lasting impact. With unforgettable performances and a story that resonates on so many levels, it’s a film that stays with you long after the credits roll. I can’t help but give it a 10/10.', 'Simple, I would say, beauty in the art of cinematography and storytelling.', 'The Shawshank Redemption is a timeless masterpiece, blending powerful performances with a poignant narrative about hope and friendship. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman deliver unforgettable performances, creating a deeply emotional story of resilience and redemption. With its captivating plot and profound themes, it remains one of the greatest films ever made.', ""The Shawshank Redemption is one of those timeless classics that pulls you in with its heartfelt storytelling and remarkable performances. At its core, it’s a story about hope, friendship, and the resilience of the human spirit, set against the bleak backdrop of Shawshank prison. Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne and Morgan Freeman as Red deliver deeply moving performances, capturing the bond that grows between two men confined by walls but freed by hope. Every scene feels purposeful, and the script, adapted from Stephen King’s novella, is simply brilliant in how it weaves small moments into a powerful narrative.\r\n\r\nOne of the most unforgettable parts of the movie is Brooks’ storyline. Watching him leave the world he knew, only to find himself unable to adapt to a society that had progressed beyond his comprehension, is heartbreaking every time. It’s a stark reminder of how institutionalization can strip people of their ability to live freely, even after they've served their time. That moment, along with Red’s own journey, adds a bittersweet layer of realism to the story’s broader themes of freedom and redemption.\r\n\r\nThe direction by Frank Darabont is masterful, turning what could have been a straightforward prison drama into something deeply profound. The setting of Shawshank feels both oppressive and oddly serene, perfectly capturing the tone of the story. The simplicity of the plot is its strength, allowing the characters and their emotional arcs to take center stage. With its pitch-perfect pacing, poetic dialogue, and an uplifting finale, The Shawshank Redemption remains a film that resonates on every rewatch. It’s not just a movie; it’s an experience.""]"

From The American Film Institute to as voted by users on the Internet Movie Database (IMDB) it is consider to be one of the best. As a film that ranks as high as other masterpieces including Citizen Kane, Pulp Fiction and 12 Angry Men, The Godfather is an exceptional piece of cinema excellence that is flawless and is simply the pinnacle crime drama.\r\nThe Godfather revolves around the Corleone’s, an Italian family with deep roots in the New York City mafia. The head of the Corleone’s is Don Vito Corleone, a man who takes care of his family and demands respect in return. His son Michael however, who just returned home from World War II, doesn’t want to become involved with the family business. The Sollozzo’s, a family of drug dealers, confront Don and request protection in exchange for profits from the Sollozzo’s drug sales. But Don declines the offer, for he is against selling narcotics. The rejected offer starts what turns into an all out mafia war between the two families with Michael diving deep into the mafia lifestyle.\r\nThe characters are portrayed by a legendary all-star cast including Marlon Brando as Don, Al Pacino as his son Michael and James Caan as Don’s oldest son Sonny. The casting for this film has been considered by many to be the best casted film in history for their astonishing performances. All three main actors were nominated for an academy award, but only Marlon Brando won an Oscar for best actor in a leading role. It’s fascinating to watch how these characters change over the course of the movie, with one in particular changing drastically.\r\nDirecter Francis Ford Coppola, being raised in an Italian-American family in New York, understood Italian culture exceptionally and made the film very authentically. Everything from the wedding dances to the cuisine to the terms used by the characters in Sicilian come from Coppola’s first-hand knowledge of Italian-American culture. Italian composer Nino Rota did an outstanding job making the soundtrack for the film, despite not getting the Oscar for best music (but he did win an Oscar for his work in the sequel, The Godfather: Part II). Virtually everyone recognizes that iconic trumpet solo once it starts playing. He also wrote the score for another great Italian film 8 1/2. \r\nThis film should be immediately followed up by it’s sequel, The Godfather: Part II, which also won best picture. The series still holds the title of most best picture awards for a film series to this day. They’re both flawless crime dramas and have earned their titles as some of the best pieces of cinema ever. I will guarantee you won’t be able to see this film only once, as it gets better after continual viewings. There is really nothing more to add other than if you haven’t seen this movie yet, it’s about time you did. The Godfather is a movie you can’t refuse.', ""The best movie ever...\r\nA masterpiece by the young and talented Francis Ford Coppola, about a Mob family and their drama, the story telling is perfect, the acting good, sometimes a little over the top in the case of Thalia Shire (the sister of the director)\r\n\r\nThe 70's were the best years for Hollywood."", 'While I\'m writing this, The Godfather is still beloved by people who love it simply because they are told they have to love it. \r\nIt\'s written by a mobster with the sole intention of depicting the lead mobsters as demi gods. Every line and every scene in the movie and the book is meant to intimidate people into thinking the ""Mafia"" and really any mob, is a supernatural force.\r\nThis is a movie glorifying control freaks, and most critics are control freaks, and most critics are either in the mob or think they can join the mob.\r\nThe movie itself is dull and totally uninspiring, not to mention totally uninspired. For fifty years, the sheep have been cowing to the control freaks who tell them to love this movie that degrades them. \r\nThere just isn\'t anything favorable about this movie. It owes its success to people who have interests in the movie or think they can get brownie points with such people. It\'s totally Hollywood in its depressing nature, and even in the seventies it was a formula film.', 'When you get a story written quite this magnificently it would take an extreme amateur to screw it up - and Francis Ford Coppola is no amateur. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall represent the epitome of guile, sophistication, loyalty, honour and brutality in this self-adapted Mario Puzo story of the unambiguously ambitious ""Corleone"" family - they start with nothing and so the only way is up; however and whatever they need to do to get there. The characterisations are layered and colourful; Diane Keaton has no idea what she\'s getting herself into! John Cazale is great as the spineless brother ""Fredo"" too. Once again, Nino Rota pulls out all the stops to give this a score that helps cement this film\'s place as amongst the best ever made. My only criticism, and it is slight at that, is that the audio mix could have done with a bit of a boost. Much of the dialogue - especially from Brando - verges on the inaudible at times.', 'Great Movie **Ever**', 'The Godfather (1972), directed by the legendary Francis Ford Coppola, is nothing short of a cinematic masterpiece that redefined storytelling in film. Based on Mario Puzo’s bestselling novel, the movie seamlessly blends crime drama with an epic exploration of power, loyalty, and family. Every frame is a testament to Coppola’s brilliance, as he transforms a gripping tale into a timeless work of art.\r\n\r\nAt the center of this monumental film is Marlon Brando’s unforgettable performance as Vito Corleone. Brando masterfully embodies the aging patriarch with an aura of quiet menace and profound wisdom, earning him a well-deserved Academy Award for Best Actor. Al Pacino delivers a career-defining performance as Michael Corleone, evolving from a reluctant outsider to a ruthless leader in a chilling, yet utterly believable transformation. James Caan as the fiery Sonny Corleone and Robert Duvall as the cool-headed consigliere Tom Hagen also shine, each adding complexity and depth to their roles.\r\n\r\nCoppola’s direction is nothing short of visionary. His ability to craft an intricate narrative while maintaining a deliberate pace allows the characters and themes to breathe. The cinematography by Gordon Willis, often referred to as the “Prince of Darkness,” enhances the film’s iconic look, using shadows and warm tones to convey a sense of both intimacy and foreboding. Nino Rota’s haunting score, particularly the famous Godfather Waltz, further elevates the film into legend.\r\n\r\nA fun fact: The studio initially resisted casting Marlon Brando, who was considered difficult to work with at the time. Coppola had to fight for him and famously convinced the studio by showing a test reel of Brando stuffing his cheeks with cotton balls to transform into the iconic Don Vito Corleone. The rest, as they say, is history.\r\n\r\nThe Godfather isn’t just a movie—it’s an experience. It’s a study of power and morality, a family saga, and a crime thriller all rolled into one. Its influence on filmmaking is immeasurable, and its performances, direction, and storytelling remain unparalleled. This is a film that stands the test of time, and for good reason: it’s a masterpiece in every sense of the word.']"

Big money and power always keep pace with great temptation, and therefore you should always keep your ears open. After all, the knife in the back can insert exactly the one from whom you do not expect ...', 'Building on the first volume, this self-adaptation by writer Mario Puzo and director Francis Ford Coppola develops the story of the new Don - ""Michael"" (Al Pacino). His attempts to expand, and to a certain extent legitimise, the family businesses see him associating with the duplicitous ""Hyman Roth"" (Lee Strasberg) in Cuba; subject to betrayal, assassination attempts and fighting what may be a losing battle to keep his own family together - all whilst doing plenty of Machiavellian manipulation of his own. There is an equally strong parallel thread depicting how his father ""Vito"" (Robert de Niro) rose to prominence after fleeing Sicily after the murder of his family at the hands of ""Don Ciccio"". With the principal characters all now well established, we can hit the ground running with a solid and complex set of inter-connected, character-driven storylines. The superior cast deliver this story really effectively - Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton as the consigliere and wife respectively, standing out. The attention to detail alongside the instantly recognisable Nino Rota score add amply to what is just a great story of Michael\'s efforts to build upon (and honour) his father\'s legacy, before he loses all of his own, once prevailing, decency. It is long, and it does miss Brando, but Pacino is on super form as the increasingly ruthless and isolated - even lonely - figure and I reckon this is every bit as good at the ""Godfather"" (1972).', 'This Hollywood style formula movie about mobsters isn\'t as pathetic as the first or third one, simply because it is too dull and poorly directed to stay awake through.\r\nIt\'s basically just a bunch of scenes of people ""talking tough"" or getting killed, with no point.\r\nIf you\'re looking for a plot or story, forget it. There is none. It\'s a muddled mess. It appears that by the end, the chief mobster is in anguish over whether or not to kill his brother. \r\nWhy? Who knows? None of this makes sense to those of us who aren\'t born with some super psychic ESP. \r\nIt also appears there\'s some revenge, but we never know why, or who, or what.

Liam Neeson plays very well Schindler however shows his true side that he was a playboy and so on. He was not a saint. He cheated on his wife, drank excessively and spied for Abwehr, the counter-espionage arm of the Wehrmacht (German army), in Czechoslovakia.\r\n\r\nBut the true characteristics of human beings cannot be spliced even in the most fascist regimes. Sometimes character flaws bring in real joy, excitement and belief. Steven Spielberg’s movie, Schindler’s List, while important, impressive and admirable in many respects, tries to show the true face of propaganda and mass bullshit and how an entire nation can be mass brainwashed to fuel hatred amoung it’s people and bring a great nation down. Something India and Indians need to really ponder upon.\r\n\r\nAfter Germany invaded Poland in 1939, Oskar Schindler sets up an enamelware factory in Krakow that used a combination of Jewish workers interred by the Germans and free Polish workers. His initial interest, of course, was to make money. But as time went on, he grew to care about his Jewish workers, particularly those with whom he came into contact on a daily basis. In addition, helping Jews became a way to fight against what he viewed as disastrous and brutal policies emanating from Adolf Hitler and the SS. Oskar Schindler convinced German authorities his factory was vital and that he needed trained workers. But Schindler did not author or dictate the list instead, Marcel Goldberg, a Jewish “clerk” compiled it. There is a line in the movie which goes like, “That’s not just good old fashioned Jew hate talk. Its policy now” and it hits hard and makes us aware that nothing has changed in present too. Itzhak Stern, played in the movie by Ben Kingsley was one of the most powerful character more of culmination of lot of people at that time. Oskar Schindler was a great man publicly and a not so great man privately but he saved the lives of more than 1,000 Jews during the Holocaust and that’s why a movie has been made on him. The imperfections in his character and the nuances in the historical record only make his story more remarkable.\r\n\r\nThe movie’s budget was just $22 million. No one had ever made a profitable film about the Holocaust. Spielberg himself didn’t take a salary, calling it “blood money.” Something Vivek Agnihotri and makers of “The Kashmir Files” should ponder upon. As I write this Kashmir Files has already touched 250 Cr. Such sensitive films should come with not just spontanity but also empathy which is found in Spielberg and lacks in Agnihotri’s.\r\n\r\nThis movie reminded me of another Spielberg movies which moved and caved in Bridge of Spies. Bridge was about the fine art of negotiation and the List is about the fine art of “Gratitude” you will hear this word a lot in the Schindler’s List. I felt both the movies very similar and fantastic.\r\n\r\nThe use of black and white cinematography also makes me think of “KOTA FACTORY” both shot in black and white to resemble the dark and hollowness of the subject material. Art does make you uncomfortable and that’s it’s Dharma and Karma but propoganda does give you only the bigoted narration with giving the example that his master is always a good guy.\r\n\r\nIn one scene, Schindler implores Goeth to spray water into the cars on a hot day to help the dehydrated Jews inside. Goeth tells him that to do so would give false hope—a clear implication that the trains deliver Jews to their deaths.The lists become increasingly ominous during sorting exercises to determine who is fit to work or who is “essential” and who is not. Those deemed “unessential” are placed on the list to be evacuated to extermination camps. Stern’s name appears on a list sending him to Auschwitz. When Schindler saves him, an SS officer mentions that it doesn’t matter which Jew gets on the train, and that keeping track of names just means more paperwork. This disregard for names and particularity symbolizes the extent to which the Nazis dehumanized Jews. Schindler’s list is one that saves lives. The Nazis’ lists represent evil and death, but Schindler’s list represents pure good and life. In an ironic twist, the final list in the film is a list that Schindler’s workers give to him—a list of their signatures vouching for Schindler as a good man, to help him if Allied soldiers catch him. The saved in turn become saviors.\r\n\r\nThe one-armed man who thanks Schindler for employing him and making him “essential” is shot in the head by an SS officer as he shovels snow the next day. Blood flows from his head, staining the surrounding snow. In a later scene, Goeth orders the execution of a Jewish woman engineer who tells Goeth of a fatal construction error. Her blood, too, pours from her head and darkens the snow around her. The blood pouring from the victims’ heads is both literally and metaphorically the lifeblood being bled out of the Jewish race. In yet another scene, Goeth attempts to execute a rabbi working at the Plaszów labor camp. The rabbi stays kneeling as Goeth again and again attempts to shoot him in the head. But the gun jams, and the rabbi is spared, symbolizing the tenuous protection the Schindlerjuden had and the fine line between life and death.\r\n\r\nThe film talks about the corruption of not just money but hearts and minds too. It shows us privileges and different aspects of life while keeping humanity before profits and ideologies. Intricacies of personal and professional lives are intertwined here for the good sake.\r\n\r\nThe film ends with – “WHOEVER SAVES ONE LIFE, SAVES THE WORLD ENTIRE.”\r\n\r\nThe actual Oskar Schindler died in 1974 and was buried in Jerusalem on Mount Zion. He is the only former member of the Nazi Party to be honored in this way. He and his wife Emilie were named Righteous Among the Nations by the Israeli government in 1993, something that would be hard to believe could happen without the film highlighting his life. \r\n\r\nAs we all know, Spielberg and the film went on to win several Academy Awards for Schindler’s List, including Best Picture and Best Director. The film also won for Best Screenplay, Best Cinematography, and Best Editing. Spielberg would win another Best Director Oscar for Saving Private Ryan five years later, but for him what happened with Schindler would be his crowning achievement. \r\n\r\nSchindler’s List is a rare movie whose legacy is just as important as its existence.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the lasting legacy of the film, aside from tolerance, is the image of the girl in red. During the liquidation of the ghetto scene, we see a little girl wandering. She serves as the person Schindler and the audience fixate on. The weight of the atrocity that we carry as viewers.When prompted to talk about one of the only color moments in the film, the girl in red, Spielberg told USA Today, “In (Thomas Keneally’s) book, Schindler couldn’t get over the fact that a little girl was walking during the liquidation of the Krakow ghetto. While everyone was being put on trucks or shot in the street, one little girl in a red, red coat was being ignored by the SS.”\r\n\r\n\r\nFor Spielberg, that came to symbolize the blind eye world leaders turned to the murders going on in Europe. “To me, that meant that Roosevelt and Eisenhower—and probably Stalin and Churchill—knew about the Holocaust… and did nothing to stop it. It was almost as though the Holocaust itself was wearing red.” Same repeats in Ukraine too.\r\n\r\nSpielberg helped develop and found The Shoah Foundation. It furthered the education and established “The Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation” to document the testimonies of thousands of survivors. For Spielberg, he wanted future generations to have these eyewitness accounts to serve as a permanent record. He hoped that there would never be a time we saw Nazism and fascism on the rise again. The project has collected the testimony of more than 55,000 survivors and witnesses to the Holocaust as well as other atrocities. “It wouldn’t have happened without Schindler’s List,” he said. “The Shoah Foundation wouldn’t exist.” Something the Hypocritic Vivek Agnihotri should think about. I still stand by that “The Kashmir files” should be shown to everyone without propoganda and only one agenda that this atrocities and “Genocide” should not be repeated on any one anywhere.\r\n\r\nThe film is available on Netflix. Go, watch, think.\r\n\r\nhttps://letterboxd.com/mayurpanchamia/film/schindlers-list/\r\n\r\nhttps://mayurpanchamia.wordpress.com/2022/03/27/schindlers-list/\r\n\r\nhttps://www.themoviedb.org/review/62405d62706e56005dc24c03\r\n', 'There\'s a powerful little low-budget effort with Ralph Richardson called ""The Silver Fleet"" (1943) that illustrates just how difficult it was for those in the occupied territories to continue to do what was right without looking like a collaborator and/or ending up against a wall of Nazi bullets. Well here, Steven Spielberg takes that dangerous occupation and scales it up somewhat as the eponymous Czech industrialist and arms manufacturer (Liam Neeson) finds his increasing revulsion to the brutality of their new occupying power driving him, with the able assistance of his Jewish factory manager ""Stern"" (Ben Kingsley), to find ways to keep them from being routinely slaughtered. Getting them out is not really an option, so he invents ways of convincing the authorities that they are more useful alive and decently fed/housed - even suggesting the usefulness of children\'s small fingers to polish shell casings - to avoid them being deported to the now fully functioning Auchwitz extermination camp. The story is history but the manner in which it is delivered here is poignant and potent. Schindler\'s gradual shift from a venally induced indifference to one of active concern is well handled by Neeson\'s considered performance and Kingsley works well as his low-level but crucial co-conspirator. Plaudits must also go to Ralph Fiennes with, I think, the best portrayal of his career as the odious Commandant Goeth who combines just about every element of the worst in human nature into one ghastly individual eliciting a palpable degree of loathing. Does it need to be 3¼ hours long? Well I\'m not so sure about that, and there are times when the repetitive oppressiveness of their gruelling environment risks de-sensitising the message a little, but for the most part the abusive and terrifying lives led by the Jewish prisoners and the increasingly perilous path being taken by those trying to help is well held together with some stunning cinematography and an untypical John Williams score. It\'s definitely a big screen occasion - somehow television reduces it\'s impact, so if you can see it in a cinema. Either way, it does offer some salutary lessons in man\'s inhumanity, and humanity to our fellow man!', ""Emotionally powerful and historically very important. This film deals with possibly the hardest topic in human history, and it does it with class, purpose and excellent filmmaking. Liam Neeson is brilliant as Schindler; Fiennes is utterly horrifying as the terrible Goth and all the other character actors hit the mark brilliantly. The decision to make it black and white makes Schindler's List stand-out and feel distinct, it is a piece of genius. In the end this film is about the utter depravity that humanity is capable of, and the utterly brilliant heroism humanity is capable of, WW2 and the Holocaust in real life brought out the worst in us as a species and it bought out the best of us, this film captures that, but it also captures the complexities of the people at the heart of the most dramatic events in world history, no other film does this as well. Top quality and a very good start point for people who are unfimilar with the nitty-gritty of the Nazi regime.""]"

Except for two short scenes at the beginning and end of the film, it's filmed entirely on one set, that of the jury deliberation room.\r\n\r\nSweaty, gritty, claustrophobic - all words that sit snugly in the context of Lumet's excellently crafted deconstruction of 12 men trying to arrive at one verdict in the case of a Puerto Rican youth on trial for the murder of his father. The evidence appears overwhelming, there's witnesses, a murder weapon and motive, the boy is surely on his way to the electric chair. 11 of the men are convinced he's guilty, only one man stands alone, Henry Fonda's juror number 8, who refuses to turn in a vote of guilty until the evidence and facts are discussed at length. As the others rail against him and tempers get frayed, juror number 8 prompts the others to examine their own prejudices and commitment to justice.\r\n\r\nA lesson in tight direction and editing, and with performances to match, 12 Angry Men is quite simply not to be missed by those seeking to venture into classic cinema. 9/10"", ""Jurors:\r\n\r\nMartin Balsam\r\n\r\nJohn Fiedler\r\n\r\nLee J.

This is the first impression one may have, upon reading what this movie is about: 12 jurors deliberate about a murder case, where the accused suspect is the victim\'s son, a 18 y.o. boy.

Ultimately, not all is what it seems - specially true regarding *all* the jurors. Worth re-watching as much as you feel like finding all hidden clues and details therein.', ""Twelve jurors are sent to their deliberating room after hearing the evidence in a murder trial. It's potentially the hottest day of the year as this collection of white, male, individuals take their seats around the table and wait for foreman Martin Balsam - none of the characters have names, here - to call them to order. A first vote is in order - it's a slam dunk - the accused is obviously guilty - 11-1! Henry Fonda is the dissenter. What has he seen that the others missed? What has he not seen that the others have understood? What now ensues is one of the best written and characterised, compelling, dramas cinema has ever produced. Excellent efforts from Lee J. Cobb, in particular, but from all concerned allow the tension to positively leap from the screen at us. This story gradually fills us in with the details of the crime, with the statements of the witnesses and, initially at any rate, illustrates just how cursorily many of these men treat this case. They want to get home for dinner, for a baseball game, to their wives and children. The fact that they are considering the life and death of an eighteen year old man seems tangential to the inconvenience they are facing or to the value they place on this man's survival. Reginald Rose's original screenplay takes us through the whole gamut of human bigotries and intolerances with everything from ageism, racism, respect and sexism rearing their ugly heads as the tension in their discussions rises and the true nature of these characters starts to emerge. Timidity, assertion, rationality - all are on display as these men start with a position that they may well not end up with. Ninety minutes seems far too short - but it works very well, rarely coming up for air - but what will their verdict be? Big screen if you can. Not because the scenario (a jury room) needs it - but there is so much energy and vitality in this film, that is just the best way to appreciate it a strong cast who put their all into their roles - and it works!"", ""**A very well-made film, with great actors.**\r\n\r\nAs a non-American myself, it's a little tricky for me to understand how well this justice system works. Don't get me wrong, but in my country it is not usual to resort to this type of trials, where the decision depends largely on the lawyers' ability to convince a group of jurors. Here, the decision depends more on the judge, or on a collective of judges. Resorting to a jury trial is provided for in Portuguese law, but must meet a tight set of prerequisites, which turns out to be a very unusual option.\r\n\r\nSo to understand this movie better I had to go read a little bit about how a real life jury trial works. And this is where my doubts about this film are greatest. Is it really a film that respects what really happens in the room where a jury deliberates what sentence to pass? Throughout the film, it is quite clear that the trial did not go well, mainly due to a largely ineffective defense and incapable of securing the interest of the accused (something difficult to admit, especially in a case of capital punishment). Could the jury have done anything about it other than pass sentence? I confess, I don't know. I leave this to the jurists, lawyers and people who can understand more about the subject.\r\n\r\nThe film is a bit like one of those plays that ends up being taken to the cinema: the action takes place overwhelmingly in the same environment, quite confined, and with a limited group of characters who interact with each other and dialogue. Dialogues are an essential part of the film and they are not always nice. It is noted that there is an increase in tensions, and if there are several jurors interested in dismissing the matter and leaving, this changes little by little, as the details are analyzed and doubts about the trial increase. It is a frankly well-written, well-directed film (Sidney Lumet's best) and with a strong and competent cast where Henry Fonda assumes an unequivocal role, giving us one of the best works of his career. Also, Lee J. Cobb deserves a round of applause for the way he interprets and acts, in a deeply caustic character. Every actor has the time and material he needs to do a good job, and they all did.\r\n\r\nOn a technical level, it is an extremely discreet film, largely due to the low budget it was limited to. However, it is one of those films that proves that it is not necessary to have infinite money to do an excellent job. The setting is very believable, but where Lumet shined was in his clever use of cinematography and shooting angles to amplify feelings of confinement or discomfort. Sometimes, the camera gets so close to the actors' faces that we can see how much the excessive heat and subject tension is getting on their nerves."", '.']"

After each of the prequel ""Star Wars"" films, I rated that one the best, as good as any of the originals...for a time, until my opinion balanced out and I had a more well-rounded take. For that reason, I steer away from that mindset, and did for ""Dark Knight"".\r\n\r\nThough my opinion is solidifying already after having seen a Warner Bros. screening last night, ""Dark Knight"" ably stands on its own with or without ""Batman Begins"". At a two and a half hour runtime, it\'s definitely an epic of a movie, but one that never runs out of gas. A delightful addition to this experience was a healthy amount of IMAX footage, which significantly adds to the feel of being on a personal, and gruesome, tour of Gotham City.\r\n\r\nChristian Bale plays such a well rounded Batman and Bruce Wayne, qualities that none of those who have donned the cowl before him have pulled off. I still have to remember that Bale is British since he speaks with such a spot on American accent. Bale has a particular slurring lisp that serves him quite well, charmingly for Bruce Wayne and threateningly for Batman.\r\n\r\nCountering him is the late Heath Ledger, who plays such a scary and creepy Joker that I found it impossible to NOT have chills half the time I saw him on screen. What really separates this brand of Joker from Jack Nicholson\'s portrayal is true unpredictability. It\'s obvious that, to be a good guy and think like the Joker, it really takes a toll, and it sure isn\'t easy.

Christopher Nolan has brought us the Batman trilogy that it made it feel it could happen today. Christian Bale returns as Batman, was able to perform as wonderfully as he did in Batman Begins. The one person that ultimately stole the show had to be the late Heath Ledger who played as the Joker. His performance as a psychotic clown terrorizing Gotham City was one of the best performance as a superhero villain. One of the best parts of the Joker was when he was telling his victims on how “he got his scars?”. Another great part was when he kidnapped a police officer and he was recording it while scaring the man and also giving a warning to Batman. The supporting actor and actresses did a good job of delivering the story. I was disappointed that Katie Holmes did not return as Rachael Dawes but the actress how played as her Maggie Gyllenhaal did a really good job. One of the best parts of Christopher Nolan is that in every movie of his, the cinematography would look amazing and this movie is no exception.', 'A Masterpiece!!! I Love how The Dark Knight shows to me the ""Dark & Gritty Tone"". Overall, Nolan give us the Game changing, best superhero film OF ALL TIME. For me it\'s 10/10', 'A sickening, borderline fascist film that is simultaneously dull and harmful. The editing represents that of an anti-pirate commercial and the politics are beyond reprehensible. The film ends with a monologue about how violent law-enforcement and brutality is what the country needs, but does not deserve. Nolan clearly did not intend for any subtext, yet that is not an excuse, if anything, that makes it worse. He includes these scenes to make the film more dark and edgy, yet there are people, from suppressed countries, who have to live through the hardships of violence from law-enforcers and dictatorship every day, and in his obliviousness, Nolan thinks that using this in a superhero film is a good excuse for self-importance. He is a war profiteer, and exploiter, and this is nothing short of disgusting.', 'Unforgettable crime film with good dialogue, thrilling action and chase scenes and once again a magnificent cast (most notably a terrifically terrifying Ledger) and superb score.\r\n\r\n10/10', 'Heath Ledger is outstanding in this follow up to the 2006 ""Batman Begins"" outing for the caped crusader. His portrayal of the malevolent ""Joker\' is confident and highly entertaining, treading a fine line between supreme intellect and total insanity with considerable aplomb. He comes back to terrorise ""Gotham"" after ""Batman"" (Christian Bale), ""Gordon"" (Gary Oldman) - now Commissioner in charge of the police force, and newly installed District Attorney ""Dent"" (Aaron Eckhart) had made progress getting the criminals off the street. The ""Joker"", meantime, decides that the best strategy is to rob the mob - and pitching them all against each other, and with the help of the duplicitous ""Lau"" (Chin Han) manages to secure enough of their funds to initiate a campaign of lawlessness that is ruthless, manipulative and good fun to watch. Not only has the man in black his new, potent, nemesis to deal with - but he also begins to realise that his childhood sweetheart ""Rachel"" (this time Maggie Gyllenhaal) is drifting into the arms of the new DA. it is also pretty clear that they are both now proving to be an useful additional weapon in the armoury of his enemy who knows, increasingly, which buttons to press to cause maximum anxiety among those who would bring him down. It\'s over 2½ hours long, but really does fly by as the quickly paced action really does kick in right from the start. The story is dark and gritty but the pace isn\'t ponderous and moody - Ledger exudes a sense of peril throughout the whole thing, but that has an edge to it - a sophistication that plays well against the flawed superhero who is increasingly having to identify and cope with his own demons. Sir Michael Caine pops up now and again as his shrewd butler ""Alfred"", always striving to keep his boss on the right side of sanity, and Morgan Freeman continues to feature (sparingly) and his quartermaster. On that latter front, there are loads of new gadgets that still have that element of plausibility to them (no super-powers!). On balance I think I still preferred the first film, but as sequels go - this takes, and will take, some beating. On a big screen in a packed cinema, it\'s just a great experience.', ""**Overall : A cinematic marvel and once-in-a-decade masterpiece.**\r\n\r\nThis isn't simply a superhero movie or a Christopher Nolan film. The Dark Knight is a masterpiece. A perfect film. An epic scale with magnificent action pieces, oscar-winning performances, incredible writing, excellent pacing, dazzling special effects, and the list goes on and on, including the set design, costumes, and more. But, Christopher Nolan did more than make the greatest superhero movie of all time. He made one of the greatest movies of all time! All this is elevated further by Heath Ledger's once-in-a-lifetime portrayal of the Joker. Ledger was born for this role with a performance in league with Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter or Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday."", 'Even worse than Tim Burton\'s Batman, although obviously copying the neo Nazi ideology of ""kill all the brunettes you can in a movie"".\r\nThis is so predictable and so poorly written that it boggles the mind. Yet there is a fan base of what can only be described as neo Nazis. I guess those fans were poor cuckolds who got jilted by too many brunettes at a young age, and they couldn\'t get over it.\r\nThat\'s about the entire story here. Oh, the Joker kills anything he sees. Whoopee. And he\'s invulnerable. And he\'s a demigod who can only be beaten by another demigod.\r\nSo, we\'ve got traditional mundane Greek heroes and villains here, just like most Hollywood movies.\r\nUnfortunately, the fans of these traditional Hollywood movies are the loudest people on Earth, and the biggest control freaks. It\'s ridiculous to believe there are actually this big a percentage of fans for this kind of depressing Hollywood formula movie making, but if you look at Imdb\'s top 250, you see such movies make up over half of the top 250. Are they voted up because control freaks vote more than non control freaks? Or are they voted up because control freaks use many fake user names? Probably both, which explains why over half of the top 250 are nothing more than Greek traditional idolizations of control freaks.\r\nOh, and Batman turns totally gay, which would be okay if he\'d admit it, but he\'s given the choice of saving a man from death or a hot woman from death, and he chooses to save the man. This isn\'t any real Batman. It\'s just another contrived story line for the Nolan Nazi merit badge. They are not even subtle. They bang you over the head with their worship of Adolf and Eva. \r\nGod help the world if this garbage still has a fan base fifty years from now. But it could happen. We may have drug addicts and meth heads around for even longer than that, praising the hate and feeding the hate. It would be nice if someone made a real Batman movie with a real story line involving some degree of motivation.', 'I enjoyed watching the Dark Knight. They were at least able to keep the same batman from the the last one made too.', 'If I can hold my pee for a whole two and a half hours rewatching a film I’ve already seen then I love it.', 'The Dark Knight (2008), directed by Christopher Nolan, isn’t just another superhero film—it’s a gripping piece of cinema that balances action, emotion, and a deep exploration of morality and chaos. It’s the kind of movie that lingers with you, not because of its spectacle, but because of the questions it asks and the unforgettable performances it delivers. Chief among those is Heath Ledger’s Joker, a portrayal that reshaped how we see villains.\r\n\r\nLedger’s performance as the Joker is nothing short of extraordinary. He’s chaotic and unpredictable, yet his presence is magnetic—every moment he’s on screen feels alive with tension. From his unsettling voice to his haunting laugh, he created a character that’s terrifyingly human yet larger than life. Ledger didn’t just act the part; he became the Joker, and it’s a performance that still sends chills down your spine. It’s no wonder he was awarded a posthumous Oscar—this wasn’t just a role; it was a transformation.\r\n\r\nChristian Bale continues to bring depth to Bruce Wayne, exploring his inner conflict and the weight of his decisions as Gotham’s protector. Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent adds a tragic layer to the story, showing how even the noblest intentions can be corrupted. Gary Oldman, Michael Caine, and Morgan Freeman bring warmth and stability to a world teetering on the edge of chaos.\r\n\r\nWhat really sets The Dark Knight apart, though, is Nolan’s storytelling. He doesn’t just focus on action—though the film has some of the most intense sequences you’ll see—but on creating a story that makes you think. The way it explores the fragile balance between order and chaos, the cost of heroism, and the power of fear, makes it a deeply compelling watch. Add to that the breathtaking visuals and Hans Zimmer’s score, which pulses with urgency, and you’ve got a film that’s as thrilling as it is thought-provoking.\r\n\r\nHere’s a fun tidbit: Ledger’s iconic scene where he claps in the jail cell was entirely unscripted. It’s one of those moments that perfectly captures the Joker’s unsettling genius, and it’s all thanks to Ledger’s improvisation.\r\n\r\nThe Dark Knight is a film that deserves all the praise it gets. It’s intense, thoughtful, and unforgettable, with Heath Ledger delivering one of the most iconic performances of all time. If you haven’t seen it yet—or even if you have—it’s a movie that’s always worth revisiting.']"

If you\'re not an admirer of Stephen King books/films (I\'m not), DON\'T let that deter you from viewing this beautiful and spiritually-profound film; it\'s by no means a typical horror story, although it does have a couple of horrific scenes.\r\n\r\nRunning 3-hours, it\'s over my limited attention span, and yet it\'s somehow utterly engrossing, even on repeat viewings. It\'s character/dialogue driven, unique and unpredictable. Don\'t mistake this for a run-of-the-mill prison flick. The fact that it largely takes place in a prison in the 1930s is a secondary issue.

He\'s an incompetent coward, but he also happens to be the nephew of the state governor, so tends to get away with his obnoxiousness towards the prisoners. That nasty behaviour becomes more pronounced when the giant ""Coffey"" (Michael Clarke Duncan) arrives. Also newly arrived is a small mouse which befriends, much to the chagrin of ""Percy"", a fellow inmate (Harry Dean Stanton) and oddly enough it seems to help keep the peace as people come and go. Things take quite an intriguing turn when some physical contact between their gentle giant and ""Edgecomb"" seems to cure his liver complaint. As the officer realises that this man may well possess healing hands, he and his team begins to bond with him. Meantime, the ghastly little ""Percy"" screws up his first execution causing an effect straight out of a Wes Craven film and Sam Rockwell\'s psychopathic ""Wild Bill"" arrives to liven things up. It\'s actually Rockwell who steal this for me. His performance is viscerally effective and he really does commit to the role. It\'s over 3 hours long but the acting is almost perfect as these characters develop and the story unfolds reconciling the brutality of racism, crime and punishment with the attempts at humanity and decency applied by virtually everyone whose lives are touched by these scenarios - even amongst the staff who struggle at times to keep their own priorities in kilter. One of Stephen King\'s much better stories with depth to the personas, a good baddie to loathe and a message of redemption delivered subtly but powerfully.']"

It’s an engrossing, stylish and near perfect movie, and its underlying themes go beyond merely pointing out class exploitation to challenge the logic of capital. Though he is often juggling a mosaic of characters, themes and social issues, Bong never eschews his anarchic impulses and dark humour.

When a friend of the son, Ki-Woo’s, who is an English tutor for the daughter in the wealthy Park family, has to leave his position, he recommends Ki-Woo for the job. Now having an ""in"" with the wealthy family, the Kims begin plotting the downfall of the current household servants and inserting themselves into those vacant positions, making them all gainfully employed and with money finally flowing into the household. But not everything is as it seems in the Park house or with their previous servants.\r\n\r\nThis movie starts out as a comedy and quickly goes into social commentary, pointing out the differences between the poor working class family and the wealthy privileged family. The differences are ones that get commonly pointed out with the well-to-do having what usually gets termed as first-world-problems, while the poor family is literally trying to survive and save meager possessions in a flood. It doesn’t shy away or try to be subtle about it, but interestingly enough, we don’t feel beaten over the head with it either, which is a major change from the ham-fisted approach taken by most filmmakers. Couching this in a comedy is a good approach, as well, as the audience’s guard is let down and we become more receptive to the ideas.\r\n\r\nHowever, I do say it’s MOSTLY a comedy. The third act takes a dark, dark turn, and the contrast, not to mention general disdain and even indifference, between the classes becomes much more severe. This gets into some hard territory, and characters that we’ve found quirky and even come to like in some ways show very different sides of themselves. At the same time, it doesn’t feel unexpected, almost like we could tell that this was under the surface all the time and tried to ignore it, but aren’t surprised by it when it does show up. This is some masterful characterization!\r\n\r\nAnother aspect of note is that this film is rich in allegory and metaphor. It’s a smart film, yet at the same time the filmmakers are not condescending about it. They give the audience credit for being able to understand the symbolism and don’t spoon feed you everything, which is a refreshing change from the usual head-beating most filmmakers go for. At the same time, they understand that not every audience member will understand or immediately pick up on every symbol, but they have crafted this so carefully and so perfectly that you don’t have to understand each and every one. That understanding merely enriches the experience, but isn’t essential to it.\r\n\r\nThis film has gotten some recognition, and deservedly so. It is rich, intelligent, and polished to a degree that we sadly don’t see as often as we should nowadays, showing the filmmakers are masters of their craft. This is easily one of the best films I’ve seen in 2019. Highly recommended!', 'This is VERY HIGHLY OVERRATED. \r\nThe most part of the movie is foul-playing, most of those scenes seem to have been copied from the 1999/old Vijay’s movie: Minsaara Kannan [IMDB: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7562630/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_2], (Warning: This again might be a copy of some other movie as well]. \r\n“Morse code” has been used in a much better way in 2017 Ajith’s film: Vivegam [IMDB:https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6878378/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0] [Letterboxd: https://letterboxd.com/film/vivegam/]\r\nI just don’t understand what makes this movie so special that it has been appraised so highly.

Btw: Where does this kinda BS trend start off?', ""errbnb\r\n\r\nNews that Adam McCay is collaborating with Bong Joon Ho to retool Parasite as a Netflix series makes me positively giddy. Parasite is easily the best movie I've seen since the Big Short. Joon Ho's compelling ease of execution alongside the effortless lure of the plot's trappings had me hooked in an instant. I would have been happy watching this family fold pizza boxes for two hours. The story, like the family, takes on a life of its own, rapidly elevating to a setup impossible to sustain. The Bunuelesque occupy-the-rich scheme gleefully, blissfully ascends to lofty heights only, inevitably, to hit the fatal fan. The poor buggers ultimately find themselves literally chin deep in their own sh*t. The hotsy-totsy aristocrats, meanwhile, host a lovely garden party that flips into a tragic Shakespearean bloodbath. It's all fun and games till someone loses a daughter. (Note to the rich: Check the references of new hires and think twice before inviting riffraff to your afternoon functions). Decades in the making, the implosion of a middle income buffer and a widening disparity between social classes make Parasite a must-see for all income brackets. You don't have to be rich or detest or envy the rich to enjoy this instant classic. But please, whatever you do, don't try this a home, folks. Never combine the rich and poor without safety goggles or outside the confines of a controlled and supervised laboratory setting."", '""You know what kind of plan that never fails? No plan. No plan at all. You know why? Because life cannot be planned.""\r\n\r\n\'Parasite\' is absolutely fantastic. I\'m still buzzing how good this movie is. Unpredictable and nuts. You know, this summer I was starting to get a little worn out with the endless sequels, remakes and soulless crash grabs, so I find it refreshing we get movies like this once awhile.\r\n\r\nI admire Bong Joon-Ho as a director, especially his Korean movies. Not to say I dislike his English language films like \'Snowpiercer\' and \'Okja\', but in my personal opinion those don\'t match the same quality as his Korean movies and there isn\'t a sex pest trying to control his work. Anywhere, Bong Joon-Ho is one of the best working directors alive and \'Parasite\' proves it.\r\n\r\nThe movie perfectly blends drama and comedy so effortlessly, it basically breaks the impossible. And the comedy is actually hilarious and well written with the execution being sold on the actors. The thing I love so much is how funny, thrilling and intense the movie can be, hijacking all senses and emotions all wrapped into one - only a few directors can pull something this unique.\r\n\r\nThe performances from everyone was brilliant and there\'s so much depth to each character, they make the movie as captivating as it is. The cinematography was beautiful, the music was remarkable, and the movie says so much it\'s the reason why I was engaged throughout.\r\n\r\nI highly recommend people to avoid knowing anything before going in, because trust me it will add to your experience.\r\n\r\nOverall rating: Finally, a breath of fresh air. My second favorite movie of this year.', 'If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nYes, I know. I\'m late as hell. I don\'t really have anything to offer you besides my personal opinion. Theses and video essays are breaking down Parasite at such a deep level that I can\'t really write anything new. Nevertheless, I\'ll share my thoughts on it because it would be a massive miss from someone who considers himself as a film critic. I had this movie on my watchlist since last summer, but I kept delaying it, underestimating my time. So, no, I\'m not just watching Parasite because it won Best Picture at the Oscars, I always planned on it.\r\n\r\nIn addition to that, yes, I also love it like most people, and no, I\'m not writing this because I\'m ""following the pack"". Bong Joon Ho simply delivered one of 2019\'s best films, and it\'s definitely cracking a spot in my Top10. I really enjoyed what Bong did with Okja, and I\'m a massive fan of Snowpiercer. Therefore, this isn\'t just another South Korean flick. It\'s directed and co-written by someone who has been proving himself for quite some time. Even though I still defend that Sam Mendes deserved to win Best Director for his work on 1917, I\'m more than happy that a foreign movie finally won Best Picture, and what a film to do it!\r\n\r\nIt can be described as a dark dramedy, but I think social satire is more adequate. The differences between the rich and the poor are beautifully shown on-screen exclusively through visuals. There\'s so little exposition, which is one of the reasons why Parasite has one of 2019\'s best screenplays. The balance between explaining something and leaving it ambiguous is perfect. Throughout the runtime, Bong Joon Ho leans on an actor\'s face so that the audience can understand what that character is feeling through its expressions, which will explain its actions later on.\r\n\r\nThere\'s a sequence that surely has been heavily discussed for the past months. It\'s raining, and Bong cleverly divides the screen with how the wealthy family is dealing with it against the poor neighborhood where the Kim family comes from. The gorgeous cinematography, the unforgettable musical score, the seamless editing... Everything about this sequence is technically flawless, and it carries such an emotionally powerful message. Something astonishing and beautiful to look at for some can be a horrible disaster for others.\r\n\r\nIt\'s a movie that balances a lot of tones. In ten minutes, the tone goes from funny to dramatic to suspenseful to scary to absolute tragedy... and it all feels incredibly realistic. That\'s one of my major compliments to Parasite: I never felt like it was fiction. I never thought ""this is too much, this would never occur"". Even in the third act, where the narrative takes some bold decisions, everything makes sense with what had been shown until then. From shocking character actions to surprising plot points, Bong and Han Jin-won\'s screenplay is excellent.\r\n\r\nEveryone in the cast is fantastic, but Song Kang-ho is the standout, in my opinion. His role as the father of the Kim family is brilliant. I\'m actually surprised he wasn\'t nominated for Best Actor in more award shows. I created a connection with this family in such a way that the ending truly impacted me. It\'s tough to deny that the writing is what makes Parasite the phenomenon that so many people fell in love with, myself included.\r\n\r\nTechnically, I don\'t have any defects to point out. It\'s one of those films that I firmly believe in having virtually no flaws. I\'m in love with the score, I gasped several times at the impressive cinematography, and the editing is perfect. Whatever genre the story decides to go to, it\'s always entertaining and extremely captivating. Its comedy is very smart, and it made me laugh a lot of times. Its dramatic storylines kept my eyes always focused on what was happening. Even when it briefly delves into the horror territory, it\'s more suspenseful and scary than most of that genre\'s flicks nowadays.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Parasite genuinely surprised me. With so many people hyping it to a ridiculously high level, my expectations were very moderate. Nevertheless, I love it as much or more as everyone else. I know that watching it this late can make some people question my opinion/rating, but I would never love a movie because I ""should"" or because other people do. It deserves every award it received, especially the ones concerning the screenplay. It\'s one of the best original stories of the last few years, and it\'s written in such a brilliant manner, with beautiful visual storytelling instead of the overused exposition. An emotionally resonant message is present throughout the whole runtime, and the various tones are balanced seamlessly. Technically flawless: cinematography, score, editing... everything\'s absolutely perfect. Nothing is placed without purpose. Not a single line of dialogue is wasted. Bong Joon Ho is a phenomenal filmmaker, one that cares about the art and everything that comes with it. He truly put his heart and soul into this, and it would be a shame if anyone fails to watch this magnificent movie just because it\'s in a foreign language. Please, don\'t make such an awful mistake...\r\n\r\nRating: A+', ""Decent enough dark comedy/thriller, with nice performances and an engaging story, though not entirely sure it was Best Picture worthy though reserving judgment as I've only seen one other nominee, Joker which I loved but not worthy of a BP.\r\n\r\nI don't know, maybe I'm a bit disappointed given the awards the film won and my viewpoint would've been different seeing it a couple weeks back. As it is, had some entertaining and thrilling moments, but emotionally can't say I was invested... **3.75/5**"", '**_An uncategorisable masterpiece_**\r\n\r\n>_We fat all creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves for maggots. Your fat king and your lean beggar is but variable service – two dishes, but to one table._\r\n\r\n- William Shakespeare; _The Tragicall Historie of Hamlet Prince of Denmarke_, 4.iii.23-24 (1599-1601)\r\n\r\nWhat is one to make of the utterly uncategorisable and impossible-to-define _Gisaengchung_ [_Parasite_]? Only the third film to win both the Palme d\'Or and the Academy Award for Best Picture, after Billy Wilder\'s _The Lost Weekend_ (1945) and Delbert Mann\'s _Marty_ (1955), _Parasite_ is one of the best-reviewed films of the century thus far and caused huge waves when it became the first non-English language film to win Best Picture. Co-writer and director Bong Joon-ho also tied with Walt Disney for the most Oscars awarded to one person in one night – four (Best Picture, Best Foreign Language Film, Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay). On top of that, he became the first person in history to win more than three Oscars for a single film. In short, Parasite has had a significant, and relatively unexpected, impact.\r\n\r\nBut what exactly is _Parasite_? Described on its official website as a ""_pitch-black modern fairy-tale_"", even a comprehensive plot summary wouldn\'t adequately delineate its real nature – part comedy of manners, part social satire, part heist film, part thriller, part horror, part family drama, part farce, part economic treatise, part social realism, part tragedy, part allegory. And that\'s just the opening scene! It\'s the _Ulysses_ of cinema, adopting and shedding genres so often and so seamlessly that it effectively becomes its own genre. And, like _Ulysses_, it\'s exceptional in just about every way – screenplay (co-written by Bong and Han Jin-won), directing, cinematography, _mise en scène_, editing, production design, sound design, score, acting. There\'s not a weak link here, in a film that achieves that rarest of things – it lives up to the hype.\r\n\r\nThe Kim family are down on their luck. Father Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho), mother Chung-sook (Chang Hyae-jin), daughter Ki-jeong (Park So-dam), and son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) reside in a tiny basement apartment, with their only window looking out onto a popular urination spot in a back alley. With all four unemployed, they eke out a meagre living folding pizza boxes for a nearby restaurant. However, their fortunes change when Ki-Woo meets Min-hyuk (Park Seo-joon), a childhood friend who is now at university. Min-hyuk works as an English tutor for the daughter of a wealthy family, but he\'s soon to leave Korea, and so suggests that Ki-Woo take over. Armed with a fake diploma created by Ki-jeong on Photoshop, Ki-Woo successfully applies for the job. The Park family, father Dong-ik, (Lee Sun-kyun), mother Yeon-gyo (Cho Yeo-jeong), daughter Da-hye (Jung Ji-so), and son Da-song (Jung Hyeon-jun), welcomes Ki-woo into their lavish home, and upon discovering just how wealthy the Parks are, the Kims hatch an elaborate scheme to oust the Park\'s current domestic staff and take their places. And so, hiding the fact that they\'re all related, Ki-taek is hired as a chauffeur, Chung-Sook as a housekeeper, and Ki-jeong as an art therapist for Da-song. However, it doesn\'t take long before things start to go very, very awry for both families, in ways none of them (or the audience) could ever have imagined.\r\n\r\nWe live in an era where wealth is distributed upwards and the gap between the haves and have-nots is wider than ever. According to inequality.org, the richest 1% of the world\'s population controls 45% of global wealth. At the same time, adults with less than $10,000 capital make up 64% of the population and control less than 1% of the wealth. In 2018, Oxfam reported that the wealth of the 26 richest people in the world was equal to the combined wealth of the 3.5 billion poorest people. This is the _milieu_ of _Parasite_, a film which taps into some of the same ideological thinking as gave rise to ""_Hell Joseon_"" sentiments, wherein up to 75% of Koreans aged 19-34 want to leave the country. \r\n\r\nObviously enough, Bong\'s main themes are class division and class conflict, the artificiality of societal hierarchy, and the concomitant social inequality and differentiation in status that makes such a hierarchy possible in the first place. As thoroughly entertaining (and funny) as the film is, it remains, in essence, an economic treatise, albeit with a savagely satirical quality. However, make no mistake, this is a satire with teeth – the hilarity and playfulness of the long first act give way to a darker political vibe in the second, before Bong violently deconstructs his own allegory in the emotionally draining and batshit insane third act, ultimately driving the knife home in an epilogue that\'s about as different from the film\'s early scenes as you could imagine. Of course, this is far from the first time Bong has dealt with issues of class, touching obliquely on similar themes in _Sarinui Chueok_ [_Memories of Murder_] (2003), _Gwoemul_ [_The Host_] (2006), and _Madeo_ [_Mother_] (2009). _Parasite_\'s engagement with class and economics, however, is far more overt, aligning it with Bong\'s English-language work, _Snowpiercer_ (2013) and _Okja_ (2015). Never before, however, has he been this caustic, this acerbic, but so too this compassionate, this witty. Indeed, _Parasite_ feels like a culmination, the film to which he\'s been building for his entire career.\r\n\r\nIn the film\'s press notes, Bong states;\r\n\r\n>_I think that one way to portray the continuing polarisation and inequality of our society is as a sad comedy. We are living in an era when capitalism is the reigning order, and we have no other alternative. It\'s not just in Korea, but the entire world faces a situation where the tenets of capitalism cannot be ignored. In the real world, the paths of families like our four unemployed protagonists and the Park family are unlikely ever to cross. The only instance is in matters of employment between classes, as when someone is hired as a tutor or a domestic worker. In such cases there are moments when the two classes come into close enough proximity to feel each other\'s breath. In this film, even though there is no malevolent intention either side, the two classes are pulled into a situation where the slightest slip can lead to fissures and eruptions. In today\'s capitalistic society there are ranks and castes that are invisible to the eye. We keep them disguised and out of sight, and superficially look down on class hierarchies as a relic of the past, but the reality is that there are class lines that cannot be crossed._\r\n\r\nIn this manner, the film works as a literalisation of the theory that co-existence between the various classes is becoming increasingly difficult; the Kims and the Parks aren\'t simply differentiated due to wealth, rather they live in completely different worlds and have vastly different, and largely incompatible, ideologies.\r\n\r\nOne of the most deftly-handled elements of the film is Bong\'s avoidance of the clichés one so often finds in films dealing with economics – the Kims are by no means the default protagonists, a victimised family immediately worthy of sympathy, whilst the Parks are by no means the default antagonists, a callous family immediately worthy of scorn. Rather, the Parks are depicted as perfectly friendly and pleasant whilst the Kims are shown to be liars and scoundrels. Indeed, it\'s the Kims who are the more crassly materialistic of the two families – obsessed with their mobile phones and WhatsApp, we first meet them as they\'re wandering around their apartment, phones held aloft, trying to pick up their neighbour\'s WiFi signal. Later, as they ingratiate themselves with the Parks and acquire more and more access to a wealthy lifestyle, all four Kims start to carry themselves differently, as if being in such proximity to wealth has had a physiological effect. \r\n\r\nThere are no heroes and villains here – Bong is uninterested in trucking in black and white oppositions because such rigid diametrics aren\'t the norm in the real world. For all their scheming and lying, the Kims merely con their way into menial jobs, trying to earn enough to make survival a little easier. As for the Parks, their wealth has insulated them from the world of families such as the Kims, but their greatest crimes are disconnection and ignorance, nothing more. At the same time, the Kims are depicted as a far more unified and loving family than the Parks. Although all four Kims regularly occupy the same frame, to the best of my recollection, we never see the four Parks together in the same shot; Da-hye and Da-song rarely leave their rooms, Yeon-gyo spends most of her time in the kitchen and living room, and Dong-ik is seen most regularly in his car. It\'s a wonderful bit of cinematic shorthand to convey a thematic point, with Bong utilising the visual component of the medium to maximum effect – this is a filmmaker who knows precisely what he\'s doing.\r\n\r\nIt\'s in relation to the two family\'s status as heroes or villains that the film\'s title is so important. Strictly speaking, the Korean title, ""_기생충_"" (""gisaengchung""), means ""helminth"" rather than ""parasite"", but as a helminth is a parasitic worm, the slight difference in the translation isn\'t a big deal. In any case, a parasitic organism such as a helminth lives in or on a host and takes its nourishment from that host. A simple reading of this is that the Kims are the parasites and the Parks are the hosts, with the Kims feeding off the Parks\' wealth and status. However, in a film where nothing is as it seems, things aren\'t that simple. Bong depicts the Parks as parasites as well – they\'ve been rendered relatively helpless by their wealth, unable to complete basic tasks such as driving or cleaning without the assistant of working-class employees; i.e. they sustain themselves based off of the labour of their servants. And so, just as the Kims feed off the Parks, the Parks feed off the Kims, in what quickly becomes a symbiotic relationship. Concerning this issue, in his Director\'s Statement, Bong says,\r\n\r\n>_it is increasingly the case in this sad world that humane relationships based on co-existence or symbiosis cannot hold, and one group is pushed into a parasitic relationship with another. In the midst of such a world, who can point their finger at a struggling family, locked in a fight for survival, and call them parasites? It\'s not that they were parasites from the start. They are our neighbours, friends and colleagues, who have merely been pushed to the edge of a precipice._\r\n\r\nHowever, as strong as the film is narratively and thematically, it also has an aesthetic design to die for. Hong Kyung-pyo\'s cinematography, for example, is magnificent. Hong also shot Lee Chang-dong\'s superb _Beoning_ (2018), and the camerawork here has a similar smoothness and restlessness, gliding through the Parks house like it\'s a fifth member of the Kim family. Lee Ha-jun\'s production design is also praise-worthy, with the Kims\' and Parks\' living conditions contrasted in every way; the Parks live in a pristine post-modernist semi-open plan house, accessible only by an electronically controlled gate, and hidden from the street by tall trees and dense shrubs; the Kims, on the other hand, live in a cluttered and dilapidated apartment with barely any room, their toilet situated beside the aforementioned window looking into an alley.\r\n\r\nIt\'s also in relation to production design wherein one of the film\'s best metaphors is to be found, which is also a great example of just how much of a masterwork this is, how completely Bong is in control of his craft. As a film at least partly in the tradition of the ""upstairs/downstairs"" subgenre (think James Ivory\'s _The Remains of the Day_ or Robert Altman\'s _Gosford Park_), Bong literalises the separation between those above and those below insofar as stairways are a recurring motif. The Kims live in a basement apartment without stairs, mirroring their stagnation and inability to rise in a socio-economic sense. On the other hand, the Parks\' lavish home has two main stairways – one going up, the other going down into the cellar. As Ki-jeong and Ki-woo gain more access to Da-song and Da-hye, they start to spend most of their time upstairs. Ki-taek and Chung-sook, however, along with Dong-ik and Yeon-gyo, spend most of their time downstairs, indicating a fissure between the adults and their children. The stairway to the cellar is its own unique animal, with Bong shooting it like he\'s suddenly directing a horror film (there\'s a thematic reason for this that I can\'t go into without spoilers). In this way, he bestows upon it an ominousness that, at first, makes little sense, but ultimately reveals itself to be a spectacular bit of foreshadowing. There\'s also a third stairway in the Park home, one not revealed until late in the second act, but one which has huge narrative and thematic importance.\r\n\r\n_Parasite_ is a masterpiece, with Bong, operating at the peak of his abilities, never putting a foot wrong. It could have been a self-serving and didactic message-movie – a homily to the honour of the poor or a deconstruction of the unhappiness of the rich – but Bong is far too talented for that, avoiding rhetorical cant, and allowing the film to find its own space. Quite unlike anything I\'ve ever seen, it works as allegory just as well as it works as social realism just as well as it works as comedy just as well as it works as tragedy, and so on. This is cinema as art; it\'s the best Palme d\'Or winner since Terrence Malick\'s _The Tree of Life_ in 2011 and the best Best Picture winner since Kevin Costner\'s _Dances with Wolves_ in 1990. Bong is currently working with HBO to develop a limited series English-language adaptation, which fills me with dread, but no matter what happens with that project, no matter how good (or bad) it may be, here in 2020, Parasite has proven itself very much a game-changer, a film that deserves every bit of praise it\'s received.', ""First of all it's a masterpiece, it's shows how the higher class actually judge the lower class people. At it looks like a normal story of a family who all are struggling hard to live, but their life gets changed when all four of them one by one get employed in park's house. After sometime we also got to see the frustration and anger of Kim family on park family because they were judged by them.their were no unnecessarily plot twist in the film which led the film very smoothly.

It wasn't at all what I had assumed it would be like, it has a much more comedic side to it than I was expecting - and that's a positive. Yet, it's still pretty dark. It's a great mix. The plot is one that is very entertaining to see play out - the ending is particularly nuts.\r\n\r\nThe cast do a fantastic job, especially the main quartet.

It's funny. It's disturbing. And yes, there is a powerful underlying theme of the divide between rich and poor.

Jackson), their mob boss & his wife (Ving Rhames and Uma Thurman) and a champion boxer who incurs the wrath of the boss (Bruce Willis).\r\n\r\nThe lurid, droll tale is told in a non-linear fashion, but it\'s easy to follow and the final act ties everything up nicely. The dialogue\'s witty and the story maintains your attention, despite its 2 hour and 34 minutes runtime. The film\'s stylish and pulsates with energy and innovation; it understandably influenced many 90\'s films and beyond.\r\n\r\nI put off seeing this iconic picture until almost twenty years after its release because the protagonists are all big city gangsters or somehow involved with \'em. These are lawless people who would kill a person without batting an eye. Their god is money or hedonism. Let ’em shoot each other to smithereens for all I care. But if you can look beyond this and the constant profanities, the film\'s worth your time. What redeems it for me, besides the all-around entertaining movie-making, is that it\'s a tale of redemption and the high price of stubborn folly: The wise person recognizes God’s grace and responds accordingly while the fool doesn’t and blithely goes on his (doomed) way. Once a person receives grace they naturally extend it to others. There are additional gems spiced throughout.\r\n\r\nBoth Travolta and Jackson shine here. There are several other celebrities on hand, like Harvey Keitel, with many in cameos, e.g. Christopher Walken; not to mention several formidable females, like curvy Julia Sweeney (Raquel), cutie Maria de Medeiros (Fabienne), Angela Jones (Esmarelda) and voluptuous Susan Griffiths (Marilyn Monroe).\r\n\r\nBOTTOM LINE: If you\'re in the mood for a quirky crime drama/thriller you can\'t go wrong with ""Pulp Fiction."" It\'s top-of-the-line in every way, including the subtext.\r\n\r\nTHE FILM WAS SHOT in the Greater Los Angeles area. ADDITIONAL WRITER: Roger Avary.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A', ""Insane movie! \r\nOne of the bests(if not the best) Tarantino's movies!"", 'Ving Rhames (""Wallace"") is the kingpin who provides the loosest of templates for a couple of inter-twining tales that are amusing, bizarre and sometimes down right dangerous before we get a sort of alignment at the conclusion. ""Winnfield"" (Samuel L. Jackson) and ""Vincent Vega"" (John Travolta) are a pair of dapper enforcers, despatched to retrieve a stolen briefcase. Though their manner may be precise, the execution of their tasks are usually more hit and miss, definitely messy - and frequently requiring of the specialist clean-up services of ""Mr. Wolf"" (Harvey Keitel). ""Vega"" is also charged by his boss with looking after his cocaine-loving wife ""Mia"" (Uma Thurman) and that flirts with dancing and disaster too. Meantime, ageing boxer ""Butch"" (Bruce Willis) is supposed to help the boss by taking an early dive in a fight. Instead he manages to kill his opponent! Soon he is intent on fleeing town, well at least he tries before he and ""Wallace"" end up being the playthings of some interesting characters who keep their own leather-clad gimp locked in a box... It\'s really difficult to make sense of the narrative in writing. It flows really well, but at differing speeds and in several different directions at once. The stories are violent but delivered in an almost tongue-in cheek way. The dance between ""Mia"" and ""Vega"" has become the stuff of cinema legend; there is loads of chemistry - especially between Travolta and an on form Jackson who really does deliver his biblical verses with a puritanical - an lethal - zeal; Willis is as good here as he ever was and you cannot but feel sorry for poor old ""Pumpkin"" (Tim Roth) and his pal ""Honey Bunny"" (Amanda Plummer) whose habit of committing petty robberies when they realise that nobody ever thinks to hit a restaurant, all goes awry. The dialogue is cleverly targeted, with wit and pith but also used sparingly when the first rate soundtrack is allowed to let everyone come up for air. Tarantino himself features towards the end as just about everybody gets their just desserts. This is a classy and sharp piece of enigmatic and enjoyable cinema held together well by a creative and visionary director who appreciates how to get the best of a cast that know how to entertain!', ""Tarantino is the most overrated director of our times, all his films are silly but people say they are masterpieces, perhaps they are but not for the right way, the only good thing about Tarantino is that he isn't afraid of revenge for the sake of making his characters good."", 'really fun to watch and the attention to detail is great', '**One of the unavoidable movies to know Tarantino… but I think it\'s not as incredible as it is sometimes said to be.**\r\n\r\nThis was one of the films that consolidated Tarantino\'s career and made him one of the ""superstar"" directors who, whenever he releases a film, whether good or bad, attracts a legion to the cinema. I was never a fan of his, and I don\'t think I will be. He made some films that I liked and others that I hated. I wouldn\'t call it regular, a “safe bet”, but we can\'t deny it, it\'s original, true to his style and doesn\'t seem concerned about pleasing anyone.\r\n\r\nThe film follows more than one plot: we have a couple of violent bandits who try to rob a cafeteria, we have a boxer at the end of his career who has to flee after winning a fight he had agreed he would lose, we have a couple of murderers in the pay of a mobster who are tasked with recovering a stolen suitcase, and we also have the capricious girlfriend of that same mobster, whose boredom forces her darling to assign one of his assassins to babysit for her. What unites them all? In addition to the fact that they naturally intersect, they are all part of the same violent, brutal and marginal universe.\r\n\r\nFor many, this film is one of the best of the 90\'s. I would never consider it as such, that is, for me, an exaggeration. It\'s reasonably good, it\'s gained cult status, it has fans, but it\'s not a masterpiece, not for me. It\'s not a boring film, it doesn\'t tire us out and the various sub-plots are intertwined very well, with skill and elegance. There\'s a lot of violence, heavy slang and drugs, and that can be really hard at times, I felt that too. However, this heavier language, drugs and violence end up being a natural part of the underworld of crime and marginality where the characters move, so it\'s something we can count on right from the start. And there are no sympathetic characters who can arouse some empathy, so it doesn\'t matter to us whether they live or die in the most unpleasant ways (and some of them suffer a lot).\r\n\r\nThese are all qualities, and will be even more valued by those who are more familiar with the “pulp” literary subgenre. I\'m not, it\'s not part of my culture, and I even had to go look it up on the Internet to understand what it was, and what its characteristics were. Despite that, there are a few things about this film that I really didn\'t like or felt over the top. One of them is the dialogues. There are scenes with a lot of dialogues, dialogues without any interest, which can dwell on boring topics, just because. One of them, right at the beginning of the film, is about foot massages, just to give a small example. There are many scenes that seem overly drawn out due to these endless dialogues. I also think the film has too many images of bare feet. Tarantino gained fame as a fetishist, but he always said he wasn\'t… watching this film makes it hard to believe him. And one of the characters, who is a murderer, makes a very long quote from the Bible… it\'s the kind of “literature” that I think an underworld murderer probably wouldn\'t know by heart.\r\n\r\nThe actors are very good, we have several notable names: John Travolta is excellent in the role he was given, with that black suit and his hair soaked in oil. Samuel L. Jackson is not far behind, and Uma Thurman is fantastic. I would say that, at least, Thurman and Travolta achieve performances at the best level of their respective careers in this film. Bruce Willis isn\'t bad, but he\'s just not that interesting. I enjoyed seeing my countrywoman Maria de Medeiros in her only major international role, I\'m sorry she couldn\'t go further, but that\'s life. Tarantino also appears in the film, and it would have been much better if he hadn\'t. He\'s a ham as an actor.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film has many qualities, starting with the excellent cinematography, with vivid colors and good lighting. There are excellent action scenes, for all tastes, and the soundtrack makes good use of several musical themes that we know very well.']"

It is a funny, sweet and emotional roller coaster of a crowd-pleaser that manages to win your heart.', ""**They're no strangers, yet they've never met.**\r\n\r\nProbably the most anticipated anime since the final film of Mr. Miyazaki. Because people know what these guys are capable of. This is one per cent sci-fi and 99 per cent fantasy. The concept is not new for us. From 'Freaky Friday' to 'The Lake House', even the recent American television film 'The Swap', you will remember a handful of names once you read this film's synopsis. Yet the film was so good, because of how well the theme was utilised.\r\n\r\nWe all know the technical brilliance of '5 Centimeters Per Second' and the beautiful romance from 'The Garden of Words'. This is an excellent mix of those two. If love either of them, or both, then you will love it as well. But if you ask me, my favourite is still 'The Garden of Words' from this director. I liked this film, enjoyed thoroughly, so liking it less than that means not a bad flick. Surely a film to recommend for anime fans, as well as for animation's (western audience).\r\n\r\nThe story of two teenagers, one from the rural Japan mountain region and the other one from Tokyo. The plot revolves around a comet that is to pass by very close to the earth. But before that event, the girl is bored with her life, so she dreams of living in a big city and that too as a boy. One day her wish comes true when she wakes up as she swapped bodies, including most of the memories with a boy from Tokyo.\r\n\r\nFor her, it is to live as she wanted and make use of the opportunity. But for him, it is like a curse, hence becomes rebellious. This thing keeps happening frequently for days and weeks. After some times, realising the phenomena is between two, they make a deal and strict order of Dos and Don'ts while away. All this until the day of comet and everything changes forever. Searching for the truth and the result of it leads to the end of the tale.\r\n\r\n> ❝Treasure the experience. Dreams fade away after you wake up.❞\r\n\r\nUnlike Miyazaki, Makot Shinkai's storytelling is quite for the matured audience. It targets adults more than the children. Particularly for not shying away to include naturally occurring events in such situation as the story develops, despite/even though the film revolves around the teens/kids. As for this flick, the concern is not big, but it depends on the nation and its culture you belong to. It is very much acceptable and as the story progress, the best things keep replacing another till the finale. So hooked to it is assured.\r\n\r\nThe film length was good and so the pace of the narration. Well written screenplay, which was based on the book of the same name. But the director admits the inspiration from the previous flicks with similar themes. They have used the real places of the anime version with fictional names, but most of the Tokyo remains same and they all were awesome.\r\n\r\nIn many scenes, the camera panning was a treat. Especially the framerate was high, so no jerks, hence very pleasurable visual experience. Like I mentioned earlier, this is a unique film, despite not a original idea. The film proved the Japan is not overshadowed by Hollywood, particularly after the decline of animes in the recent years. It's up to the quality of the product, if so, then those glory days can be brought back for animes. Anyway, now this film holds the record for highest grossed anime.\r\n\r\nApart from technical dominance, the story is also enchanting. If you like romance theme, this will serve you well. A good film for date night. But usually people would skip animation for such occasion and one should not mix up that with anime. Because why I always put apart the anime and animation is, the animes are good at beautiful romance, while its counterpart from the west focus more on comedy and adventure. But the common thing from them is the well explored fantasy theme.\r\n\r\nUsually the ends are guessable for a film like this and the same case for this in here. Only as a result of the story, you would know what's coming, but not the frame by frame scenes of it. Yeah, I liked this conclusion, the final lines said might bring you tears in your eyes, romantically, if you are an emotional person. One of the best endings, even though it was clichéd. And the credits start to roll up, while you begin to recall everything you just saw in the last 100 minutes. A must see film, so highly recommended by my side. Now I've to wait for another couple of years for such film.\r\n\r\n_8/10_"", ""An absolutely stunning film!\r\n\r\nThere is nothing to even marginally dislike about <em>'Your Name'</em>. The animation is sensational, breathtaking in fact. The amount of detail, particularly in Tokyo, is insane. It's utterly gorgeous to watch.\r\n\r\nThen you have the magnificent story, which is filled to the brim with feeling and meaning. I felt everything that it intended me to. It's also paced to perfection and is told through two memorable characters in Taki (Ryūnosuke Kamiki) and Mitsuha (Mone Kamishiraishi).\r\n\r\nKamiki and Kamishiraishi are excellent in the lead roles. Of course I don't understand Japanese and was using subtitles, yet I still felt every intended emotion from those two. Class from them. Of the others, Ms. Okudera (Masami Nagasawa) is the one that sticks out most to me.\r\n\r\nIf all that wasn't enough, you even have a tremendous soundtrack and score to boot. It really does all make for a fantastic viewing experience, one I will be revisiting no doubt and one I would undoubtedly recommend."", 'The most romantic movies I have been seen. This is a must watched movie in lifetime!', 'Your Name is a film that captivates its audience from beginning to end with its superb and incredibly unique storyline. The body swap genre is one that has been explored in various films, but the way it was intertwined with a love story in Your Name is brilliant. What sets this film apart is its refusal to hold the audience\'s hand. The first act is dedicated to determining what exactly is going on, and this ambiguity only serves to make the movie better. The final act is incredible, with high stakes and quiet moments that help the audience process the intense emotion the characters are experiencing. There is so much to like here, and I truly think it is one of the best animated screenplays ever created.\r\n\r\nThe performances in ""Your Name"" are also noteworthy. Watching the dubbed version, I felt that everyone did a fantastic job. The chemistry between the characters was superb, and nothing was overly acted, which is a problem in some anime. The voice actors managed to convey the emotions of the characters without overdoing it, making the performances feel natural and believable.\r\n\r\nThe direction in Your Name is nothing short of amazing. There were so many unique scenes that can only be done in animation, and each one was painstakingly crafted in such a way that portrays the larger narrative. The animation itself was breathtaking, with fantastic landscapes and 3D integration. It is the best animated visuals I think I have ever seen.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Your Name is a masterpiece that deserves all the praise it has received. Its unique storyline, great performances, and stunning visuals make it a must-watch for anyone who loves animation. The film\'s direction is impeccable, and the attention to detail is outstanding. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to experience a heartfelt, emotional journey that they will never forget.\r\n\r\nScore: 98%\r\nVerdict: Masterpiece', '""Your Name"" weaves a delightful tale of two high schoolers, Mitsuha and Taki, whose lives take an unexpected turn when they start swapping bodies. The unique and captivating plot keeps you on the edge of your seat, as you follow their incredible journey of self-discovery and connection. With a perfect blend of romance, humor, and emotion, this movie is a must-watch for anyone looking to experience a magical and touching story about the power of fate and friendship.

For three years in a row, Peter Jackson has banished our winter blues with the individual instalments of his Tolkien trilogy, effectively shifting the focus of our cinematic excitement from the summer months to the end of the year. But now that his epic has been unveiled in its entirety, what will be the lasting effects of his achievement?\r\n\r\nWell, grand-scale fantasy filmmaking is back on the menu, laying down the gauntlet to George Lucas and Star Wars Episode III. Jackson has also proved that notions of risk and ambition needn't be confined to the low-budget, indie end of the spectrum; nor does California have an exclusive stranglehold on groundbreaking special effects.\r\n\r\nAnd then there's the DVD factor. Just as The Lord Of The Rings was upping the stakes in theatres, so too was its DVD release pattern defining what can (and should) be done on disc for major movies.\r\n\r\nIn particular, the four-disc extended editions seem to have affected the director's thinking as to what he can get away with in his theatrical final cut. Hence the public grumbles from Christopher Lee about the non-appearance of Saruman in this final instalment. While it might have been fair to grant Lee a curtain call, Jackson quite rightly realises that it is Sauron, not Saruman, whose fiery eye encompasses all the narrative strands of the climax.\r\n\r\nThe Return Of The King marks the first time in the series when Jackson's roots as a horror filmmaker creep through. As the orcs catapult severed Gondorian heads beyond the walls of Minas Tirith, flesh-rotted ghosts draw swords alongside Aragorn and giant spider Shelob stalks Frodo through dark, web-shrouded tunnels, the film pushes the boundaries of its 12A certificate.\r\n\r\nAnd so it should, because the look and tone must necessarily grow darker as the Hobbits near Mount Doom and Mordor's evil hand grips Middle-earth ever tighter.\r\n\r\nCharacter nuances have been crafted over an unprecedented ten hours-plus of cinematic storytelling: from Strider lurking in the shadowy corner to Aragorn rallying the troops; from Merry and Pippin as bumbling fools to stout-hearted, pint-sized warriors. Only Legolas and Gimli seem to have regressed (in screen time at least) to set-piece archer and comedy sidekick respectively. At least Andy Serkis is rewarded for his Gollum voice work with an early flashback that gets his face on screen, as well as warning us that, under the ring's power, Smeagol can be as murderous as Gollum.\r\n\r\nJackson has kept the momentum of the series rolling on and on though the traditionally 'difficult' middle part and 'weak' finale, delivering a climax to the story that's neater and more affecting than what Tolkien managed on the printed page. Some viewers might feel that the director sprinkles some cheese on his extended coda, adding at least one false ending too many (even if he does ignore the book's Scouring of The Shire).\r\n\r\nBut those who have walked beside these heroes every step of the way on such a long journey deserve the emotional pay-off as well as the action peaks, and they will be genuinely touched as the final credits roll. Yes, the Ring is dead. Long live King Kong.\r\n\r\n\r\nVerdict - The resounding climax to a landmark in cinema history. But the King has now returned, the story is over and the ships are leaving Middle-earth. Ladies and gentlemen, Elvish has left the building.\r\n\r\n5/5\r\n\r\n- Alan Morrison, Empire Magazine"", ""Too much CGI, redundancy, clichés and drawn out “looks of love” for my tastes.\r\n\r\nRELEASED 2003 and directed by Peter Jackson, “The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King” adapts the third part of JRR Tolkien’s popular fantasy trilogy about adventures on Middle-Earth: Frodo (Elijah Wood), Sam (Sean Astin) and Gollum (Andy Serkis) continue to try to make their way to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Meanwhile Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas the Elf (Orlando Bloom), Gimli the Dwarf (John Rhys-Davies), Gandalf the wizard (Ian McKellen), King Theoden (Bernard Hill) and Faramir (David Wenham) join forces to fight Sauron's army at the stone city of Minas Tirith and, later, draw the forces of Modor out as a distraction for Frodo to accomplish his goal. Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan are on hand as Hobbits Pippin and Merry.        \r\n\r\nWhile I’m a casual fantasy/adventure fan and have read numerous books of the genre (e.g. Conan, Tarzan, Gor, etc.), I’ve never read Tokien, likely because I’m not into Hobbits, Elves and Dwarfs. After viewing the three movies, The Lord of the Rings strikes me as a mixture of Robin Hood, Conan and The Wizard of Oz, which all possibly influenced Tolkien’s writing of the Rings trilogy in 1937-1949. So, if you think a meshing of “Conan the Barbarian” (1982) and “Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves” (1991) with “The Wizard of Oz” (1939) sounds good, then you’ll probably like these movies more than me. \r\n\r\n“The Return of the King” is just more of the same showcased in the first two movies, but even LONGER. Take the Battle of Minas Tirith, for example. It’s basically the same as The Battle at Helms Deep in the previous movie, except with colossal elephant-like creatures and the Army of the Dead. These two battles are similar enough that they could’ve been condensed into one conflict. Speaking of the Army of the Dead, this was an interesting new element, as was the horrifying spider-monster that Frodo & Sam face inside the caves.   \r\n\r\nLike the first two movies, the characters are diverse, the tale is creative, there’s a lot of dark action rounded out by softer scenes and everything LOOKS and SOUNDS magnificent. Unfortunately, as with “The Two Towers,” there’s excessive use of CGI (aka CGI porn). If cartoony CGI is your thang then you’ll likely appreciate this installment more than me.        \r\n\r\nThere are other problems: While the characters are inspired, they’re also thin and rather uninteresting, at least for mature people who require more depth to hold their attention. Take Legolas (Bloom), for example; we never get to know him. Or consider Aragorn: Mortensen is perfect as the noble warrior, but in the ENTIRE trilogy he probably only has like two full pages of dialog, maybe three. Also, I found the story generally disengaging. I was never much enthralled by the characters and their pursuits, although devotees of Tolkien might be. \r\n\r\nThen there are WAY too many “looks of love” between characters, particularly Frodo and Sam (I was so happy to see one character get married and have kids, if you catch my drift). There’s also a sense of redundancy, like the aforementioned battles (Helms Deep and Minas Tirith). Or consider the hokey dangling from a cliff by one’s fingers: This was already done with Gandalf at the end of the first part and beginning of the next. Did we really need the entire trilogy to come down to this type of eye-rolling cliché?    \r\n\r\nAnother problem is the lack of feminine protagonists. There’s Miranda Otto as Éowyn, Théoden's niece, who becomes infatuated with Aragorn and masquerades as a warrior-ess. Other than that all we have are cameos by Liv Tyler (Arwen), Cate Blanchett (Galadriel) and a Hobbit’s wife. “Mythica: A Quest for Heroes” (2014) cost LESS THAN $100,000 to make, which is a mere fraction of the $94 million it cost to make this blockbuster and the creators knew enough to throw in a couple of prominent babes as heroines in the story. So did “Conan the Barbarian” and “Dungeons & Dragons: Wrath of the Dragon God” (2005). It’s not rocket science. \r\n\r\nAs noted above, the movie’s needlessly overlong and things could’ve been condensed in the trilogy or omitted altogether. When the main storyline ultimately ends at Mount Doom I was thinking there was maybe 12-15 minutes left with half of that time being credits. Nope, there was STILL 30 MINUTES LEFT wherein boring goodbyes and “looks of love” are tacked on. \r\n\r\nDespite these honest quibbles, “The Return of the King,” and the trilogy in general, was an ultra-ambitious undertaking and is a must for fantasy/adventure aficionados, particularly those who favor Tolkien, Hobbits, Elves, Gnomes and the like.                      \r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 3 hours 21 minutes and was shot in New Zealand.  \r\n\r\nGRADE: C"", ""Great finale to a great trilogy. The action and battle sequences were amazing and even though I've seen this a few times over the years, still thrilling to the end. I didn't even mind the multiple endings as I had in the past, nice each character got their due. **4.75/5**"", ""An outstanding end to the trilogy.\r\n\r\nI expected a lot from <em>'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'</em> so I am delighted to see it produce on so many levels. I, funnily enough, wouldn't actually say it's necessarily the most perfect execution - what with the plot coincidences and extreme character armour. But that doesn't matter one jot whatsoever, as the story wraps up in arguably the best way - at least to watch - possible. It has so much heart and feeling to it.\r\n\r\nThe story involving the characters of Elijah Wood, Sean Astin and Andy Serkis remained the most interesting to me, I was very satisfied with how it concluded in regards to them. I also enjoyed the bits we got of Viggo Mortensen, Ian McKellen & Co. All that added to the beautiful look and creation of the film, with the world coming alive splendidly.\r\n\r\nIf I were to nit-pick further, I would say the run time is slightly too long. The pacing is absolutely fine, very good in fact, but I coulda done without a few of the many end scenes - a lot of which are necessary and welcome, but a couple could've been left out to allow the viewer to imagine how the world continued. That's just how I feel mind, I'm sure I'm one of only a few that think that way.\r\n\r\nBack onto the positives: how about those battle sequences? Astonishingly good. A sensational trilogy, no question about it. I look forward to seeing <em>'The Hobbit'</em> films."", 'As an avid fan of Tolkien\'s The Lord of the Rings from long before New Line announced this movie ""trilogy,"" I must say all three films were fairly large disappointments.  Now, mind you, I am not your usual, ""The book is better"" movie reviewer.  But it is almost like Peter Jackson went out of his way to take out the most crucial elements of the books and replace it with drivel.  Also every line that sounds even remotely cool in the books must be given to Gandalf, no matter who actually said it...  That\'s just frustrating, despite Sir Ian McKellen\'s stellar performance.  With what I would hope is the obvious exception of Orlando Bloom\'s third dismal performance as Legolas, the actors all did quite well; the characters were just not allowed to shine as they do in the books.\r\n\r\nI see that the common consensus is that this movie is too long, and I agree.  What\'s most frustrating about that to me is that this movie had to finish The Two Towers since that film did not complete, and then this film left out the pivotal ending of the saga.  The Return of the King is actually the shortest volume of the three (there are six books, two in each volume).  As some have noted, the film noticeably scraps the scouring of the Shire, but for those who might have hoped for a fourth installment to finish that story, Peter Jackson dashed all hopes by disturbingly killing off Saruman at the beginning of the extended edition.  By the by, I understand many people feel that the scouring of the Shire is anticlimactic after the final defeat of Sauron, but for myself, I think the point that there is still evil in the world, and that heroes must still rise to fight it, is one of Tolkien\'s triumphs.  Back to my main point, though: the books were shorter while telling more story, because despite his depth and detail, Tolkien understood how to drive  a story along.  Peter Jackson, on the other hand, fails on that count.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I am someone who always hoped that these movies would be made (I grew up watching the animations produced by Rankin/Bass and Fantasy Films).  But now I suppose I\'ll have to wait until someone is daring enough to try again, despite the overwhelming success of these films (which will probably not happen in my lifetime).  In the meantime, I\'ll continue to read the books every year.', 'A fitting end to a classic trilogy.\r\nFrodo, Samwise, and Gollum journey through a Hell on what is called ""Middle Earth"", while Gandalf, Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas go to war. King Theoden must decide whether to help those who would not help him. Merry wants to war, but is too small. Pippin finds himself getting in more and more mischief.\r\nLots of subplots. Never a dull second. Masterfully dierected.\r\nWhat more can be said? Truly mesmerizing every step of the way, and a movie with maybe four endings that just lead into each other, and we still can\'t get enough.', 'I\'ve just seen this on the big screen for the first time since I saw it at London\'s sadly now long-gone Odeon at Marble Arch, which - at the time - boasted the biggest screen in the UK, and it has lost little of it\'s magic. Continuing with the interwoven tales of ""Frodo"", ""Sam"" and their treacherous guide ""Gollum"" as they trek through fire and brimstone to get the ring to Mount Doom; whilst Gandalf, Aragorn and the surviving members of the fellowship try to stem the might of ""Sauron"" and his armies of orcs and their allies. While this is undoubtedly a magnificent piece of cinema, I find the story drags a bit. I found the the focus to be too much on the less interesting characters - the lovelorn ""Eowyn"" (Miranda Otto); the delusional ""Denethor"" (John Noble) and decent but rather wimpish ""Faramir"" (David Wenham) as ""Gondor"" faces the wrath of their nemesis, and that slows the pace from the action just when it ought to be building. The delightful, friendly, rivalry between ""Gimli"" & ""Legolas"" features all too sparingly and it\'s got too ponderous a narrative to sustain the four hours the otherwise visionary Peter Jackson has created. Fortunately, the triple-header quest with Elijah Wood, Sean Astin and a superb Andy Serkis keep the other strand moving along suspensefully and tensely. The battle scenes are superb, though - when we get them, the effects really do rise to the occasion and, of course, the striking cinematography coupled with the inspired themes from Howard Shore contribute to a thoroughly entertaining adaptation of a thoroughly captivating fantasy adventure. If you make it past the start of the credits, there is the gloriously haunting ""Into the West"" from Annie Lennox to top off this finest of trilogies. The Oscar/BAFTA awards this achieved are a just reward for years of stunningly creative effort from thousands of people who turned the imagination of a 20th Century English academic into films that will last forever.']"

Robert Zemeckis uses a chronology of events in the USA, starting in the 1950s, to create a template for the story of a man who lived through racial tension, war, bullying and emerged the stronger; the more honourable and despite his low IQ was quite capable of putting those more intellectual around him to shame. The photography that cleverly superimposes him into television broadcasts works entertainingly as he gazes bemusedly out onto a audience that is increasingly warming to him. I will admit, I struggled a bit with the running segment towards the end, but Hanks epitomises determination and integrity with Eric Roth\'s adaptation of the Groom novel allowing plenty of philosophical food for thought whilst having a laugh at scenarios both serious and ridiculous. Like life itself, this film is like a box of chocolates and though I didn\'t love them all, there were plenty to enjoy and reflect upon.']"

He\'s tall, blonde, he smokes a cigar, and he\'s a pig!\r\n\r\nIt\'s debatable of course, since there are legions of fans of the first two films in Sergio Leone\'s Dollars Trology, but with each film there not only came a longer running time, but also a rise in quality - debatable of course!\r\n\r\nHere for the third and final part of the trilogy, Leone adds Eli Wallach to the established pairing of Lee Van Cleef and Clint Eastwood, and brings all his tools of the trade to the party. Plot is slight, the three principals are on a collision course to find some buried gold, with each man having varying degrees of scuzziness, so how will it pan out?\r\n\r\nSuch is the genius of the narrative, it\'s a fascinating journey to undertake. The characterisations are ripe and considered, the various traits and peccadilloes beautifully enhanced, and with Leone being Leone, there\'s no shortage of cruelty and humour. He also brings his style, the close ups, long shots and some outstanding framing of characters in various situations.\r\n\r\nThe story encompasses The Civil War, which pitches our leads into ""The Battle of Branston Bridge"", where here we get to see just how great Leone was at constructing full on battle sequences. It\'s exciting, thrilling and literally dynamite, whilst Aldo Giuffrè as Captain Clinton turns in some memorable support.\r\n\r\nThe Euro locations pass muster as the Wild West, superbly photographed by Tonino Delli Colli, and then of course there is Ennio Morricone\'s musical compositions. It\'s a score that has become as iconic as Eastwood\'s Man With No Name, a part of pop culture for ever more. It mocks the characters at times, energises them at others, whilst always us the audience are aurally gripped.\r\n\r\nThere\'s obviously some daft coincidences, this is after all pasta world, and the near three hour run time could be construed as indulgent. But here\'s the thing, those who love The Good, The Bad and the Ugly could quite easily stand for another hour of Leone\'s classic. I mean, more barbed dialogue, brutal violence and fun! Great, surely!\r\n\r\nFrom the sublime arcade game like opening credit sequences, to the legendary cemetery stand-off at the finale, this is a Western deserving of the high standing it is held. 9/10', 'Sergio Leone\'s <i>The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly</i> is a classic Western film. Clint Eastwood is the Good, aka the Man with No Name, a taciturn wanderer who follows his own sense of justice. His opposite is Angel Eyes (Lee van Cleef), the Bad, a brutal mercenary who kills anyone who stands in the way of making ready cash. The film\'s comic relief is Tuco (Eli Wallach), the Ugly, a Mexican bandit wanted in several states who ends up inadvertently doing some good turns. At the height of the Civil War, as Union and Confederate armies battle each other in the West, these three men vie for an abandoned cache of gold coins.\r\n\r\nThe film is especially memorable for its pace and cinematography. The opening scene, for example, juxtaposes closeups of anxious faces with vast panoramas of the Western landscape, and 10 minutes passes before a single word is said. It is like Tarkovsky transplanted to a vastly different setting. That\'s not to say it\'s all so serious, though. In a sense the film is a ""two buddies on the road"" movie, with Tuco the wisecracker and Eastwood\'s character the straight man. It is also a war film, with Leone apparently sparing no expense in presenting a realistic image of hundreds of men charging each other on the battlefield. This is not among the greatest films I\'ve ever seen, but it\'s very well-made.\r\n\r\nBecause this is a ""spaghetti Western"", an effort in the genre realized by a joint Italian-Spanish production team with American lead actors, the film has some curious qualities. Because of the use of locals, all the faces of Civil War soldiers are so clearly Italian, even though Italian immigration into the US picked up only later. The Mexican bandit Tuco is played by a Jew from New York, and furthermore Leone mocks the character\'s Catholicism in a way that Americans of the era would, although the faith would be in no way foreign to his Italian audience.', 'I am not a fan of Sergio Leone. In fact, this movie and Once Upon a Time in the West are the only movies of his that I have seen. But I think they are both classic westerns. He seems to bring out the best in his cinematographer, both for scenery and for his characters.\r\n\r\nIn one review I read, he was criticized for staying with facial close-ups too long, and I would probably agree if he populated his movies with beautiful actors and actresses as many films do, but he relies heavily upon actors with interesting faces.\r\n\r\nSometimes I feel he relies on too many shootings, and on having his gunfighters be too damn good. Two, four, six opponents? Doesn’t matter, these guys kill them all and come out unscathed.  But that is part of the western movie gunfighter mystique.\r\n\r\nOn a different level, I have owned the soundtrack for this movie: The Good the Bad and the Ugly, for close to 50 years. I write novels in my spare time, and I started listening to this soundtrack (plus others like Thunderball) for background music as I wrote. I moved on to Ambient music, such as Brian Eno, but still listen to this album. As a side note, I heard a great version of this movie music on YouTube, performed by the Danish National Orchestra. Check it out.\r\n\r\nSo the movie works for me on multiple levels, and I own a copy so I can watch it any time the mood strikes me', 'There is one word to define The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. And that word is “transcendent”. This movie is not only the pinnacle of the Spaghetti Western, but it transcended into the pinnacle of the Western genre in itself. It’s safe to say it transcends that too, and can be considered one of the greatest pieces of filmmaking ever. It counts with memorable performances by three different leads, a story that breaks the “black and white” concepts of morale, and an original score that can only be defined by the word “epic”.\r\n\t\r\nDirected by the man responsible for the revitalization of the western in Italy, Sergio Leone, the film does an incredible job of introducing every character, and showing each and every one has a dubious concept of moral values. “The Bad”, Sentenza, or Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef), is shown to be a ruthless, greedy gun for hire, but also someone who lives by the mantra of always getting the job done. “The Ugly”, Tuco, is a  greedy backstabber, but he is also a man who comes from an extremely poor environment and family conflicts, showing a bit of determinism in the film. “The Good”, Blondie (Clint Eastwood) is not much better himself. While he is surely the less greedy one, he also has no problem with killing and backstabbing other people. To put it in perspective, he is ironically announced as “The Good” right after abandoning a man to die in the desert.\r\n\t\r\nThe story follows all these three personalities as they engage in their particular gold rush: a buried treasure that is hidden in a cemetery. In order to find it, they must form an uneasy alliance, while trying to outrun each other, and claim the prized gold alone. All of this while the Civil War happens around them.\r\n\t\r\nThe performances are nothing short of amazing. It goes to show the range that Lee Van Cleef had once this villainous role is compared to his work in the previous installment of the trilogy, For a Few Dollars More, as a heroic, friendly and almost fatherly figure. His presence is as intimidating as ever, and one of the best he has given in his lengthy career. Eastwood is as eye-catching as one would expect: his deep stares and lines delivered in a whispery, yet gravelly voice, defined The Man With No Name. But the best of the bunch has to be Eli Wallach. His comedic timing is as precise as any bullet shot in this film. But the most outstanding part of his characterization is that while he is extremely funny, he also manages to be a credible threat for the “hero”, Blondie.\r\n\t\r\nThe original music score for this film deserves a whole book just to talk about it, and it still wouldn’t do it justice. It’s simply a lesson by the maestro, Ennio Morricone, on how music can change a film. Thanks to a track such as L’estasi dell’oro (The Ecstasy of Gold), a man running around a cemetery becomes one of the most epic scenes ever made. Thanks to a composition such as Il Triello, three men staring at each other, pondering their options for almost seven minutes straight, becomes tense enough to have the viewer on the edge of its seat. There is simply no other way to put it: Morricone crafted one of the best scores in this art’s history.\r\n\t\r\nAt the end of the day, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is more than just a great western film. It’s a show of great acting, writing, directing and music scoring. It’s a real once in a lifetime classic, that has been around for a long time, and not aged a little bit, and will still be talked about for generations of cinephiles to come. To conclude, all I can say is… There are two kinds of people, my friend. Those who have watched this film, and those who have not. You watch.', 'Solid western, which generally isn\'t a favorite genre of mine, with great performances and some well shot scenes and landscapes. Been a long time since I saw A Fistful of Dollars or For a Few Dollars More, but this is a great entry in the ""Man With No Name"" Trilogy. **4.0/5**', 'Very good no doubt about it, even if I feel it\'s an odd fitting third installment of the Dollars trilogy.\r\n\r\nIn case this review sounds negative at any point, I wanna explicitly state for the avoidance of any doubt that <em>\'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\'</em> is very good! Any cons noted are relative.\r\n\r\nI just feel like it\'s a drop-off from the brilliant double of <em>\'A Fistful of Dollars\'</em> and <em>\'For a Few Dollars More\'</em>. The near 3hr run time is one of the reasons, though the pacing is actually pretty good in fairness. I guess it\'s more so the plot, which is filled with an American Civil War setting which I didn\'t feel matched the characters.\r\n\r\nThe man in the middle/bounty hunting aspects of the original two films are perfect for the characters of Clint Eastwood & Co., whereas them tagging along for the war just felt odd; the story didn\'t feel as raw or volatile to me.\r\n\r\nAs stated, it\'s still - on its own merits - an entertaining western. Eastwood remains quality, while Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach are extremely worthy onscreen counterparts. I will say Van Cleef feels forgotten about, probably just by me, towards the end until he magically reappears. Still, as a trio they are really enjoyable. The plot away from the war is properly fun, much more in keeping to what I was expecting. The score is also awesome, yet again.\r\n\r\nMinus the ACW and a shorter run time and I\'d probably be classing this as great as AFOD and FAFDM. It\'s still very good though, which I evidently want to stress, and I\'d definitely revisit it.\r\n\r\n<em>watched: ""Extended English-language version"".<br>\r\nEven though this version is the same as the original Italian release (177 minutes), but seemingly the US shortened run time is considered the true incarnation? Odd.</em>', 'Not as bad as the other Leone Westerns.\r\nStill, that is not saying much at all.\r\nAt 3/10, this is better than his totally ridiculous ones.\r\nIt\'s still a dull movie with non credible one dimensional characters who have no motivation for a single thing they do.\r\nThree homicidal maniacs who are called good, bad, and ugly, but really they\'re all just bad and ugly.\r\nEli Wallach steals the show. I think most people agree with me on that, and for some people he saves the show, but I need better writing, and more ""credible characters in incredible circumstances"" than we get with Leone.\r\nBlondie (Eastwood) kills anyone he sees in the wild. He kills other bounty hunters to steal their prisoner to bring in for rewards.\r\nIt\'s a good thing we didn\'t have Allied soldiers like Blondie, or else all Germans would have to do to win the war would be surrender and let American GIs kill each other to steal prisoners to bring in. Imagine that. We would have lost WW2 if our soldiers were like Blondie (or Manko, or whatever his name was).\r\nThe attempts to humanize the homicidal maniacs played by Clint and Eli only work for the brain dead idiots who buy into that. Such brain dead idiots don\'t last long in the hood or in volatile situations. Sadists do not get human. They only act human at times to get innocent victims to lower their guard.\r\nThe three man shootout at the end is stolen from the pair of movies ""The Jackal"" and ""Yellow Sky"", and I\'m not sure if it\'s better or not. Neither one is in a top one hundred all time movie gunfights or showdowns. It\'s weak and stupid.\r\nBut when the spaghetti Westerns came out, the drug abusers and potheads loved them, and demanded they be acclaimed. The critics were either scared of the druggies or were druggies themselves, because the critics were bigger hacks than Leone for praising this garbage. \r\nHow long will we endure the crack head idolization of this garbage? Probably another 30 years or so, until we get some mature viewers who are willing to make up their own minds about what is classic, instead of being sheep.\r\nYep, Eli spoke of sheep in another Western, but it fits here.\r\nI give it a grade on a curb to make it 3/10, although compared to 1950s Westerns it is 1/10, but I\'m lenient, because it isn\'t as bad as the other Leone Westerns. It isn\'t exactly ""watchable"", and you will fall asleep if you take it in one viewing, but the other Leone Westerns are even more boring than this one. Eli Wallach does do a great job, and for some people, that\'s enough.', ""**One of the best, most famous and most iconic Westerns ever. More than a classic, it's mandatory.**\r\n\r\nI'm not an expert nor do I want to sound like one, but I think this is one of the most famous western films ever made, despite being shot by an Italian director and being more European than American. Sérgio Leone was one of the most notable directors of his time and he left us, in this film, one of his masterpieces.\r\n\r\nThis is one of those movies that is almost perfect. Problems and failures are scarce and reside in minimal details that end up not making a big difference in the overall work. The story was very well written and takes place in the midst of the American Civil War, a time when violence was part of everyday life. In this environment of violence and mutual distrust, two men are looking for a treasure buried in a cemetery: the problem is the fact that each one knows only part of the location (that is, one knows the location of the cemetery and the other knows which grave it is) and there is a third man, a fearsome assassin, willing to do anything to take all the gold.\r\n\r\nFor this film, Leone put together a very reasonable cast, mostly European, and three great North American actors with enormous talent: Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef. I believe that they knew how to make the most intelligent and skilful use of this film, giving us a truly remarkable job. For this three actors, this is the best cinematographic work of their career, or one of the best, consecrating them as great Western movies actors. The film, however, seems to give Wallach more and better opportunities. While watching it, I got the feeling that he is the actor who receives most attention and best material, in addition to having known how to improvise at the right moments and in creative and intelligent ways.\r\n\r\nThe film has great visual beauty, emphasized by the cinematography, the filming work and the good choice and design of sets and costumes. At a time when the correct period recreation was something that cinema sometimes blatantly ignored, this film did the opposite, giving us a realistic and believable vision of the past and placing the film in a specific place and time. I'm not saying it was a one hundred percent successful effort, but it was definitely a decisive step in the right direction when it comes to period films. The special effects and visuals are excellent, the best there was then, and the whole film has an epic, grandiose, expensive feel. It is also very long, with almost three hours in length, but it is worth not being afraid or giving up on because of that. Being a Western film, it is quite evident that there is a lot of violence, so it is not a film for children. Even so, it is not gratuitous violence. Finally, we owe Ennio Morricone a salute for the excellent soundtrack he composed. Among his vast work, this is not my favorite nor the best, but it is undoubtedly one of the most recognizable and iconic pieces, a work that we know, even without having seen this film, and that has become part of our collective memory. We can't ask for more than that."", 'People tended to treat Sergio Leone\'s work with a considerable degree of disdain, but watching this in 2020 it is still amongst the very best of the genre. A good-looking, calculating Clint Eastwood (""The Good""), is the itinerant bounty hunter who has an uneasy partnership with a scene-stealing Eli Wallach (""The Ugly) to trick the local authorities of the reward money due for his capture before escaping and dividing the spoils. They happen upon a recently robbed stagecoach where they learn of the whereabout of a huge stash of gold - but they both possess different clues as to the location, so must - despite themselves - work together to track down the loot. Meantime, a thoroughly nasty Lee Van Cleef (“The Bad"") hears about their treasure hunt and is now joined in the race to the money. There is a paucity of dialogue that only enhances their performances - there are bouts of humour and although the premiss is pretty violent, there is actually very little by way of grisly, gory depiction seen on screen. The scene near the end in the graveyard with the magnificent Morricone ""Ecstacy of Gold"" theme is as good as Westerns get. The editing is not great, it has to be said - but the cinematography gives a great showcase to the scale and grandeur of the locations. Not a word I use often, but this really is a masterpiece of the cinema.']"

Every time I watch it is see something new. Bandits steal peasants rice. Peasants hire ronin samurai to defend them. Great plot, pace and acting. Akira Kurasawa's best...perhaps."", ""**Maybe a little overrated, but there's no doubt that it's good.**\r\n\r\nWell, I have to start this text with a note that I believe is relevant to understand what I'm going to write: this was the first Japanese film that I remember seeing. I might even be forgetting something I've seen before, but I don't think so. Therefore, I'm not a good connoisseur of Japanese cinema, so I don't want my opinion to be taken with any authority that I don't crave. I know there are people who want that. I do not. I speak, as in any of my reviews, only through my mouth, from the height of my meager wisdom, without pretensions. I may be right about some things, wrong about others, but that's the most normal thing in the world.\r\n\r\nI decided to see this film because it was highly recommended and well regarded… everyone said it was a very good film, so I decided to see it for myself. I just finished it, and read a little about the film and its director, the famous Akira Kurosawa. The film is really a work that is above average, but it is not the kind of film that pleases everyone, and it seems to me to be a little overvalued, which results in damage. I say this because I felt, at various times, that the film failed to meet my expectations, as I am quite neutral, that is, I neither love this type of film nor feel repugnance in watching it.\r\n\r\nThe script takes place, roughly, in the mid-16th century, when Japan was divided into feuds and kingdoms, and there were frequent internecine wars in which the samurai took part. Of course, in such an environment, it is the common people who sacrifice themselves, and the humblest have always been the most susceptible to abuse by the powerful. That's what we have here, with a rural village that is regularly looted and devastated by an armed band until it decides to hire a small group of wandering samurai to help defend it. They achieve this objective, and we are invited to see all the labors that occur in the preparation of the defense, and in the martial training of those peasants.\r\n\r\nI'm going to do it differently, and start by saying the aspects that seemed most positive to me. First, it seems to me that Kurosawa is really meticulous in the work he has done and has great affection and respect for his country's traditions and history. Otherwise, one would not understand the effort and money that were tied up in a film with such a historical and cultural load. To what extent did his taste for realism influence European cinema, or vice versa? I'm sure there are film students who have discussed this. What I can guarantee is the commitment to realism, visible, for example, in the extraordinary design of the sets and costumes, and in the static cinematography, very elegant and sharp. The script is quite solid, and gives us an extraordinarily credible story and very well-built and striking characters. I don't know the actors well, but I think Toshiro Mifune deserves applause for the commitment and work he has done here. He is an actor who naturally captures our attention and has a charisma that comes through effortlessly.\r\n\r\nOn the negative side, however, we also have several aspects to point out, starting with the length of the film, with more than three and a half hours. I'm sorry to say, but I feel that the script didn't justify that much time, and that Kurosawa didn't work the pace well. With a more restricted edition, he would have managed to reduce the film, without much loss, to two hours, and make it less heavy and exhausting. We don't need to see every village debate or every military training shenanigans. I also didn't like the attempts at humor introduced in the film. They just weren't funny at all. The excessive predictability of the story told also turns out to be a defect. I also didn't like the virtual absence of a soundtrack. I've seen that in other films, and I've never been particularly fond of that stylistic device."", 'I must begin by saying I am a bit ""attention deficit"" and that I never thought I would like subtitles, but this film flows through its long length with such adventure that I don\'t see how anyone can keep from being entranced with every second.\r\nAnd it takes a lot to hold my interest.\r\nIn case you haven\'t heard, this ""magnificent seven samurai"" so to speak, are enlisted one by one to aid a village beset by 40 bandits.\r\nWhat is often lost is that the story is really ""Four villagers"". Two are village elders (although not as old as the ""grandpa"" character they look to for advice). One, Manzo, represents the conservative element that in our era might be called ""Republican"", and the other, Mosuke, represents the liberal or ""Democrat"" policy. The other two are Yohei, a man full of fear who thinks Manzo\'s policies will protect him; and Rikiki, the boldest villager who is more in tune with Mosuke. Indeed, Rikiki might qualify as the ""eighth samurai"" as the film progresses.\r\nThere are so many wonderful subplots and so muuch excitement even when there is no action, that there\'s never a dull moment. \r\nThe samurai also have their ups and downs. Toshiro Mifune is not the leader, but he is the soul. He is much like Rikiki. \r\nThere is humor throughout that is perfectly timed, and much tragedy. I think it is Kurosawa\'s masterpiece, and he is one of the most respected directors of all time.', 'Maybe the greatest movie of all-time. This film is an epic accomplishment of long-form storytelling, amazing performances, wonderful camera work and fantastic sets. As is typical of Kurosawa, this movie attacks the theme of greed and is very willing to critically examine the high-status classes, in this case the ""honourable"" samurai. The characters are likeable for the most and the performance from Toshiro Mifune is absolutely masterful and his character is a brilliantly comic tragic character. The action is very raw with mud and rain and chaos, which I appreciate. The pacing in the middle is ever so slightly slow but it really doesn\'t detract from this utterly brilliant masterpiece.']"

It’s that rare occasion for a genre film of this type where everything artistically comes together as one. Direction, script, editing, photography, driving soundtrack and crucially an ensemble cast firing on all cylinders. It’s grade “A” film making that marked a return to form for Scorsese whilst simultaneously showing the director at the summit of his directing abilities.\r\n\r\nThe story itself, based on Nicholas Pileggi’s non-fiction book Wiseguy, pulls absolutely no punches in its stark realisation of the Mafia lifestyle. It’s often brutal, yet funny, unflinching yet stylish, but ultimately from first frame to last it holds the attention, toying with all the human emotions during the journey, tingling the senses of those who were by 1990 fed up of popcorn movie fodder. \r\n\r\nIt’s not romanticism here, if anything it’s a debunking of the Mafia myth, but even as the blood flows and the dialogue crackles with electricity, it always remains icy cool, brought to us by a man who had is eyes and ears open while growing up in Queens, New York in the 40s and 50s. Eccellente! 9/10"", 'Martin Scorsese (director) always loves details in crime films, but he is not primarily interested in the crime itself. That is why his films are always produced with details that you may see as unimportant to you, especially if you want to see the movie for the purpose of seeing scenes of theft, murder, and so on, but you see the opposite. Somewhat other details are visible on the scene mostly\r\n\r\nThe film talks about liberation, stereotypes, and entering a new world for humanity. It was Ray Liotta (Henry). He wanted, as I said, to break free from stereotypes and enter the world of gangs.\r\n\r\nMartin Scorsese (the director) filmed this unfamiliar life and directed it in the form of a film similar to documentaries because he filmed it as if it were a real, realistic life. That is why the presence of Voice Over was important in order to give you the feeling that there is a person sitting next to you telling you the story while whispering in your ear as it happens in the movies documentaries.', 'Ray Liotta is superb here as ""Henry Hill"", a man whom ever since he was young has been captivated by the mob. He starts off as a runner and before too long has ingratiated himself with the local fraternity lead by ""Paulie"" (Paul Sorvino) and is best mates with fellow hoods, the enigmatic and devious ""Jimmy"" (Robert De Niro) and the excellently vile ""Tommy"" (Joe Pesci). They put together an audacious robbery at JFK and are soon the talk of the town, but the latter in the trio is a bit of a live-wire and when he goes just a bit too far one night, the three of them find that their really quite idyllic lives of extortion and larceny start to go awry - and it\'s their own who are on their tracks. Scorsese takes him time with this story: the development of the characters - their personalities, trust, inter-reliance, sometimes divided, fractured, loyalties and ruthlessness and are built up in a thoroughly convincing fashion. We can, ourselves, see the obvious attractions for the young ""Henry"" of a life so very far removed from his working class Irish-Italian background - the wine, the women, the thrills; it\'s tantalising! If anything let\'s it down it\'s the last half hour; it\'s just a little too predictable and having spent so long building up the characters, we seem to be in just a bit too much of a rush; but that is a nit-pick. It\'s not the ""Godfather"" but it is not far short.', 'A really good film. i loved it!', 'The Goodfellas is an absolute masterpiece in every sense. Martin Scorsese delivers a raw, unflinching look into the world of organized crime that’s as captivating as it is brutal. Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, and Joe Pesci shine, each bringing unforgettable depth and intensity to their roles—especially Pesci, whose portrayal of Tommy DeVito is both terrifying and fascinating. The storytelling is flawless, pulling you in with a mix of dark humor, sharp dialogue, and iconic scenes that stay with you long after the credits roll. Add in the perfect soundtrack, and it’s no wonder this film is considered a classic. The Goodfellas isn’t just a movie; it’s an experience that I can watch over and over again.', 'I enjoyed the film. Especially the character of Joe Pesci and Robert DeNiro.\r\nGreat Film!!']"

But during the early '50s, '60s, and onward, there was a use of this thing called film. Film was what they used in cameras before cameras actually saved them into memory slots digitally.

The only bad thing I have to say about this is the lack of character development in terms of Elena's character development. I mean, she is a love interest for until Salvatore gets back to the town after his stint in the military, and then she is never heard from again.

This is  a must see film for any era, and any generation of film viewers."", ""**Magnificent.**\r\n\r\nI saw this movie for the first time a good few years ago, but I only decided to talk about it now, after seeing it again. For me, it is one of the best Italian films ever made. It's like a modern fairy tale, showing us the fascinating side of cinema and reminding us why we love it. Of course, everything passes, and cinema has gone through many phases, it has undergone metamorphoses, and the end of the great classic movie theaters was one of them. And now? The pandemic has shown us that cinema can learn to survive without its theaters. And if we consider the manufacture of televisions and sound systems increasingly “cinematic” and economically viable? Will the living room one day be our own private movie theater, with all the comfort and quality of the big screen?\r\n\r\nThe future is anyone's guess, and it's as wonderful as it is frightening, but let's put these digressions aside. Anyone who likes cinema should see this film. It has a good dose of nostalgia, it can move the audience (it moves me) and makes us think about life. It's a little difficult to explain, I think it's one of those films that manages to touch something personal in whoever sees it, and that's not easy to translate onto paper because no two lives are alike. It is also worth going to see the various films that appear on the screens of Paradise, and which are very fair tributes to several well-known films.\r\n\r\nThe cast has very strong names. It is one of the best films of Phillippe Noiret's career, which offers us such a good job that he could well have been nominated for the Oscar for Best Actor that year. Young Salvatore Cascio also does an excellent job and is believable in his role. Enzo Cannavale and Marco Leonardi also do an excellent job. Tornatore's steering is virtually flawless.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film is equally remarkable: in addition to accurately recreating the times in which everything takes place, it perfectly shows the technical evolution of cinema, and the way in which the place itself – Giancaldo – changes over time. The choice of filming locations was careful, all the work with props, costumes and sets was meticulous, and the cinematography is very beautiful. The edition does not deserve any repairs, especially if we are talking about the extended version of the film. Ennio Morricone, with his work in this film, gives us one of the best soundtracks of his career, every melody is worth listening to.""]"

Like all the Chris Nolan fans, I was equally excited to see the movie on the opening day opening show. But I slightly disappointed that it was not a digital 3D film. I agree, this science-fiction was more dramatized than usual space travel stories does with an adventure-thriller. Almost a 3 hour long stretch movie did not waste much time to take us to the core of the story. Get prepared for this extremely rare voyage into the space with a logical explanation for everything you see on the screen. Well done research for the most matured and intelligent writing. All the credit must go to Nolan brothers. A good sign from Jonathan Nolan, who can make big in the entertainment industry in a future like his brother.\r\n\r\nAs we know many had liked 'Inception', to me that was a simple multi-layered action movie, that's all. But the same stuffs that used in this film makes sense. In fact, you have to have a little knowledge over how the universe works, so then it will be easy to catch the scene and situations while watching the movie. Totally like a documentary style concept, but with the additional stuffs like characters and its emotions add flavor that gives a movie look. An educational movie, though it also can work for those who wants just entertainment. Only the slow movie pace would test their patience.\r\n\r\nIt all begins like Shyamalan's 'Signs' movie with a family living surrounded by corn field. Then switches to 'The Astronaut Farmer' and going through 'Gravity', finally meets the 'Inception'. It was just a reference to call the movie setting that brings constant change for every half an hour. Like the opening scene and the end scene had over a 100 years difference.\r\n\r\nAs I earlier said it was the story of a family alongside the future of humankind and decoding universal mysteries through travelling in space and time. This movie would a reasonable for those who thought '2001: A Space Odyssey' is a boring piece, Cleverly written cinematic piece especially for science geeks. I don't know how perfect the movie to the actual present astrophysics, but will justify for the common people's capacity of understanding with an encourageable amount of commercial elements in it to entertain as well.\r\n\r\nThe first three quarters of the movie was well made. It puts me in a unblinkable position like a story was narrated by Brian Cox in a television series. Like I said, lots of astrophysics involved in it, but strangely human emotions were also exhibited equally that I never expected one from Nolan film. It was not an ordinary sentiment, but was strong enough to make a man cry for happy and sad situations in the movie. I liked science and emotion coming together. In fact, it saved the movie, otherwise it would have been a science documentary straight from NASA production through Nolan direction.\r\n\r\nThere are many surprise elements in the movie and of course there is a twist at the end. We can call it a series of twists like the layers. Compared to last quarter of the movie to the rest, it completely detaches which opens broadly to the different directions. And that happens so fast rushing towards the other end. Which give an impression of the movie 'Inception'. In a perfect way to say the first 75% was 'The Tree of Life' and the remains are 'Inception'.\r\n\r\n‘‘This world's a treasure,\r\nbut it's been telling us to leave for a while now.’’\r\n\r\nAll the actors were so good. Matthew McConaughey steals the show as he dominates the majority of the screen space in the story presentation. There's no ruling out the fine performance executions from Anne Hathaway and the young star from the Twilight movie, Mackenzie Foy. The remaining cast was having less scope which were like the guest appearances that was widened a little broader, but was perfectly fitted for the story. Especially Matt Damon's was the crucial one.\r\n\r\nRemember the movie 'Contact', a lovely movie, which was ruined by its fictional ending. Something like that happened in this film as well. The story was initiated with a realistic approach with actual scientific contents as per the present understanding about the universe. But the end was let me down with the layered contents that kind of impossible to agree with it. As a cinematic theme it worked, yeah, a good solution for this wonderfully written story. We know that the time can't run backwards, so that's the trouble.\r\n\r\nAnyway, this movie defines in a new way, I mean scientifically the existence of ghost. It was not a horror movie, but I liked supernatural force that merged with this science fiction theme. That explains and gives vast ideas to expand our physics beyond something and somewhere yet to reach. Hats off to the director, because he was not thinking of making money here. His idea was to implement what the humans are understood so far about the cosmos. And he very nicely transformed those into the silver screen with the blend of human emotions. In my opinion, this will replace '2001: A Space Odyssey' for sometime till another one make this way.\r\n\r\nI could have not asked a better space travel drama than this, especially when I heard Nolan doing a science-fiction I believed he gonna rock it. He was so true to the science and the human feelings in this film. If you had seen enough movies before like this one, you can recall your memories like the Tom Hanks parts from 'Cloud Atlas'. But still independently stands strong and falls in a never seen before category.\r\n\r\n‘‘Maybe we've spent too long\r\ntrying to figure all this out with theory.’’\r\n\r\nThe end scene leaves a hint of a possible sequel. I would be happy if that happen in a near future, but definitely that would be a completely different cinema as per how this one ended. I know his fans want that to happen and so am I.\r\n\r\nThe visuals were not that great, but simply very good. To see those in digital 3D would have given us a different experience, sadly Nolan was not in favor of that technology. Hoping this movie would get as many as the Oscars nod. Especially not getting into the best motion picture shortlist would be a shame. Like I said I'm no one fan, I just love watching everyone's every movie. I would have went to see it again if it was converted into digital 3D, since I'm modern tech geek when it comes to the films.\r\n\r\nIt will become a talk of the week, perhaps month all over the world, so don't leave behind when your friends talk about it. What I gonna say is it is a must see asap if you are a movie fanatic like me otherwise Nolan movies does not need anyone's recommendation because his movies usually sell itself like the hot samosa."", ""People seem to think that if you enjoy a Christopher Nolan movie, you are a fanboy and the film couldn't really be that good. That is not true. He has never made a bad movie, Insomnia is probably his worst and it is still an excellent movie. \r\nInterstellar is up there in his top 3, with The Dark Knight being number 1 and Inception in number 2. I don't think he will ever make a better movie than The Dark Knight, it is without a doubt a masterpiece of cinema in my opinion. It can be enjoyed on so many levels.\r\nI remember seeing Interstellar in the movie theater and being on the edge of my seat the whole time. It was breathtaking but the end left me confused so i walked out disappointed. \r\nSince then i have watched it many times but it only took a second viewing to realize what a great ending it is and here is why. How many people discuss the end, was the wormhole open or closed for him to make it to Brand, what happens next, is there a sequel. I discuss this with people who hate the movie and the debate will still last a good 30 minutes if not more without getting heated. It is a wonderful story told through the eyes of a genius film maker who deserves more than he receives, an oscar would be nice start.\r\nI read hat his next movie is to be released in July 2017, I can't wait to find out everything about it like i have since he began.\r\nIf you're unsure about Christopher Nolan, watch his career from the beginning starting with Doodlebug."", ""Another grandiloquent movie from Christoper Nolan.\r\n\r\nThe cast is good, and McConaughey performs a role made for himself. The photography is very nice but the movie commits all the same mistakes than previous Nolan's movies. I think mistakes but it may be that they are the points Nolan fans enjoy the most ...\r\n\r\n* The story makes you believe it is a realy deeply thought plot but, in the end, it has so basic mistakes and stupidities that make it nonsensical.\r\n* There is a general ambience of every moment being epic; deep, solemn and smart dialogues but, at some point our highly trained engineer and pilot behaves really stupidly.\r\n* To keep the mentioned constant feeling of being in an epic moment, Nolan uses a thumping and insistent soundtrack. As it is not a moment, but a 3h movie, it is really tiresome.\r\n\r\nAll in all, the movie is OK but you can only think this is a great movie if you are a real Nolan fan."", '""Man kind was born on earth, it was never meant to die here.""\r\n\r\nIT has been two days since I watched it and I still can\'t get it out of my head. I can safely say that it has been a long LONG time since a movie had this much effect on me after watching it. And the only thing I can think of now is to somehow Re-Watch it again.\r\n\r\nThis movie was surprisingly different from Christopher Nolan\'s recent works because they had been great cinematic entertainment pieces catered to a wider audience with a blockbuster approach, this certainly didn\'t felt like that and hence the polarizing response it got. It is an ambitious project that is not meant to merely entertain, walk into it knowing that. I\'ll say this though, If it works for you, you\'ll be in heaven.\r\n\r\nThe premise of the movie is that Earth is no longer capable of supporting humans on it, we must find a new home to avoid extinction. This scenario is told from a very personal perspective and not from a Global scale like some sort of apocalyptic catastrophe disaster film. At the core of the movie is the Father-Daughter relationship. The movie takes its sweet time to develop it too.\r\n\r\nMathew McConaughey, not surprisingly, gives an amazing performance as the main lead. He really carries the film, some scenes were very emotional due to his great performance. The rest of the cast does a great job as well, especially the Daughter played by Meckenzie Foy. The One character that I never expected to be great was the robot TARS. He also acted as the source of the humor in the movie, well executed, timely and grounded.\r\n\r\nInterstellar tackles a lot of themes, Survival, Humankind, Love, Time etc, out of which \'Time\' had the biggest impact on me. With relativity being a big part in the film, the whole sequence about it just struck me very deeply and I found new respect for Time. I\'m actually at a loss of words to describe it. Also, there is a lot science in it so it can be confusing for many and in Nolan\'s tradition, it also has twists and mind numbing ending, where the more you think about it, the more numbing it gets.\r\n\r\nThe visuals of this movie are breathtaking. Great cinematography and CGI. The depiction of wormholes and blackholes and other space entities were the best I have ever seen. They just suck you into the movie. Along with that, you get to listen to one of Hans Zimmer\'s best scores. The score not only felt personal, going perfectly with the movie, but also different from his recent works. There were times where combination of epic photography and soundtrack made the scenes timeless, like I was completely sucked into it and didn\'t had a clue about my surroundings. I didn\'t want those scenes to end.\r\n\r\nAlas, the movie was not perfect. My biggest gripe with it is that the pacing and editing was off at times. Some scenes dragged on while others were cut far shorter. The beautiful views of space could have definitely benefited from a few seconds longer onscreen time. Also, I wished there was more space exploration in it.\r\n\r\nWith all the remakes, rehashes, reboots and sequels we are getting in these times, it is great to see original gems like these. This movie is definitely one of this year\'s best, one of Nolan\'s best work and one of the best movie I have seen in recent years.\r\n\r\n9.5/10', ""This was my most anticipated film of 2014, and I was not disappointed. \r\n\r\nThe story was slightly difficult to follow on the first watch, but that was to be expected in a film dealing with complicated fields such as astrophysics and time dilation. Many didn't find its overall message - that love is the most powerful force in the universe which transcends space and time - to be very appealing, but I thought it was an interesting take on special relativity and how two people can be bound by a common feeling, even when they're in different parts of the universe at different times. I also thought the acting was believable, for the most part, and I didn't think anyone was miscast. I enjoyed the surprise appearance from a certain famous actor about halfway through.\r\n\r\nBut what really blew me away were the visuals and the soundtrack. I believe it was Quentin Tarantino who once said movies and music go hand in hand; that a moving image complimented by the right piece of music can create art. Well, the visuals in this film, which took my breath away, and the score, which perfectly captured the 'feel' of the cosmos and all its wonder, proved him right. I think this was Hans Zimmer's best work yet, and although I'm not Christopher Nolan's biggest fan, I will continue to follow his work if he can pull off more movies like this. \r\n\r\nMy only regret was not seeing this film in IMAX.\r\n\r\n10/10"", 'That this movie, at the time of writing this, holds an 8.8 rating at IMDb is simply beyond my understanding. Needless to say I did not really like this movie. The story is not very good, the science is ludicrous and the visuals not all that impressive. Maybe the latter would be better in a big theater (I watched this on my home cinema system which has a relatively large screen by European standards) but I am not really sure about that either.\r\n\r\nBe warned that the rest of this review might contain a spoiler or two.\r\n\r\nThe movie starts of with the usual “I told you so” wet dream of the green fanatics on a dying Earth so it is off to a depressing start right away. That is an overused concept today as far as I am concerned. Then they pour it on with a school official claiming that he Apollo missions and moon landings never happened. What the f…? If they wanted to depress the audience right from the start they succeeded, at least with this audience.\r\n\r\nThe story proceeds with our heroes finding these gravity waves in the sand and by a huge stretch of imagination decrypts them to mean coordinates which leads them to the secret NASA base. Once there Cooper is told that he is their best choice of pilot for a “save the human race” mission through a wormhole. Yeah, right! This guy was former NASA. His whereabouts could hardly been unknown to them. If he was their best choice why would they entrust a mission to save the human race to someone else until he stumbled onto their door? Typical Hollywood nonsense!\r\n\r\nThe movie is full of this kind of rubbish. Romilly wastes 23 years of his life doing pretty much nothing except deciding not to go into the sleep capsule. The supposedly highly trained and vetted professor that they do find turns out to be a psychopath as well as and idiot almost blowing up the ship when trying to proceed with a docking that all the systems tells him have not succeeded. Then they proceed to dock with the main ship and stop its spin as well as bring it out of orbit around a planet with the shuttles engines. That is one hell of a powerful shuttle not to mention the strength of the docking mechanism! This just goes on. When someone is not doing something illogical or stupid (or both) they sit around talking, philosophizing and dragging the movie forward at snails pace. 169 minutes is way too much for this movie.\r\n\r\nThe movie ends up in one big time travel mess (okay they do not travel in time, just sends messages through time but still…) during a bunch of psychedelic scenes while traveling through the back hole. Science? Not so much. And what about this totally ludicrous massively illogical and inefficient robot design?\r\n\r\nThe one good thing I can say about this movie is that the performance of most of the actors, especially Matthew McConaughey, are quite good. For the rest, not my cup of tea.', 'Again hit produced by christopher nolan after batman.\r\nStoryline is great and also the science theory is perfectly showcased.', ""This might contain spoilers!\r\n---\r\nInterstellar is my favorite movie. I'm really into space and everything about it, so this movie was my cup of tea. \r\nThe soundtrack is the best of the movie. It points out flow of time, which is the most discussed issue in the movie. Special effects are breathtaking. Even with some small mistakes, it is pretty accurate and expectable. There is some visually pleasing cinematography too, including Saturn, the curvature of spacetime or majestic black hole, which is really satisfying. Some scenes are loud and thrilling, but some moments are so quiet, that you actually think, you are in space!\r\nThe movie is long but gripping. The plot, although it's complicated, is told easily and understandably. But the end of the movie is difficult to understand, since it contains time loop and time travel at the same time, but if you listen carefully, you will get it. I watched the movie 7 times and I still enjoy it!"", '""Do not go gentle into that good night; Old age should burn and rave at close of day. Rage, rage against the dying of the light"".\r\n\r\nThe story is about a team of explorers undertakes the most important mission in human history; traveling beyond this galaxy to discover whether mankind has a future among the stars.\r\n\r\nChristopher Nolan once said that 2001: A Space Odyssey was his all time favorite film and how he wanted to do a small tribute to he\'s next film. And then comes a movie called ""Interstellar"" that will put a smile on Kubrick face if he was alive today, because Interstellar is one of the best movie of 2014 and the best movie experience I\'ve had at the cinema.\r\n\r\nI saw this movie in IMAX and all through out this film I felt like I was in space floating around with Mconaughey and Anne Hathaway. I had that feeling that I was going deep into space just like are main character\'s, going deep into space just like the viewing auditions and me.\r\n\r\nThe visual effect\'s in this movie are some of the most stunning, beautiful and Jaw dropping effect\'s I\'ve seen since 2001: A Space Odyssey. The performances were brilliant, The cinematography was breathtaking and hard to look away. The directing by Christopher Nolan and let me get this out there, this man is a true director; he knows cinema and knows how to interested people into seeing he\'s films and I\'m still shocked that he hasn\'t won an Oscar yet.\r\n\r\nNow most people or critics have said that last third of this movie ruined the movie for them, but I actually like the ending to the movie. It\'s new for Nolan because he always ends on a deep and cold note, but this movie didn\'t and I didn\'t mind it.\r\n\r\nMy only nick pick with the movie is some of the character\'s in this movie wasn\'t all that interesting. Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain are the only character\'s that to me were interesting and I cared for them, but the rest of the character\'s I didn\'t really care for.\r\n\r\nOverall Interstellar is a mind-blowing movie with fantastic visual\'s, interesting story line and the movie will keep you interested till the end.', 'I will not add another in depth review to the several I see here on this movie. Nor will I try to evaluate the accuracy of the science behind the plot. Apparently a physicist was involved who had veto power if the script wandered out of the realm of what is at least theoretically true or possible.\r\n\r\nBut I have never let inaccuracies get in the way of enjoying science fiction movies anyway, as long as the movie is entertaining and otherwise doesn’t insult my intelligence. In the movie Monsters, for example, I read that giant the aliens looking like octopuses could not have walked upright. Fair enough, but it is entertainment, not a documentary.\r\n\r\nSo the human story of Interstellar held my attention in spite of the length of the film, and despite the elaborate special effects, that story drove the movie and my appreciation of it. I have always liked good time travel movies as well, and theories of space and time come into play in Interstellar as well.\r\n\r\nOh, and I say it is entertainment rather than a documentary, but it is not light entertainment. If you want to give this movie a fair chance, give it your full attention. It is not Mars Attacks, where you can watch it while distracted by life and still pick up on  plot details.', ""I've got to say I have been wanting to watch this film for a while now and well it's 2021 and it's a Saturday morning and damn, safe to say this is one of the best films I have ever watched in my life. loved everything about It. The creativity and intelligence put into this film is just mind-blowing considering the fact it is a 2014 film. This clearly shows that mankind will one day achieve the most unexpected and unthought discoveries.\r\nLove and respect to the director Christopher Nolan you are a legend."", ""It opens my mind after I watched this movie. I have watched it twice to figure out everything on the movie. Basically, this is the movie talking about earth is not a good place to stay anymore. People have to go to space to find another homeland. It reminds me that we will be like them if we didn't care much on environment"", 'As humanity faces an existential crisis, farmer ""Cooper"" (Matthew McConaughey) and his family are fighting a losing battle against an environment determined to destroy what is left of their corn crop. Mystery arrives after a sand storm leaves some magnetic clues to a secret location inhabited by NASA scientists led by ""Brand"" (Sir Michael Caine) who manage to convince former pilot ""Coop"" to join a mission to go into space and, using a recently detected wormhole that he believes may have been deliberately sent to help mankind rescue itself, set off to find another home for us all. Leaving a seriously narked daughter behind, he accepts the mission and together with the daughter of ""Brand"" (Anne Hathaway) their perilous trek begins. This is a more solid sci-fi adventure from Christopher Nolan. Though it features doses of his usual time bending scenarios, for the most part it is an exciting action film with mishaps a-plenty as their mission sees danger at just about every junction. There is a decent chemistry between Hathaway and McConaughey allowing the characters to develop with some depth that helps to draw us into to their efforts. The visual effects are superb, it has TARS - a rather clunkily designed robot that proves a whizz when running and rescuing, and the ending has something of the Escher drawing to it. The narrative can be thought provoking offering quite an interesting series of choices, especially when Matt Damon (""Mann"") joins the story and begins to challenge their approach to just what ""humanity"" might actually be! A host of celebrated co-stars prop it up well. John Lithgow is effective as the patriarch of the family and Casey Affleck and Wes Bentley help diffuse the intensity of the principal relationship as the space-bound menace gradually accumulates. It\'s all but three hours long, and there is no denying that it hits a barren spell at times during the middle hour, but for my money this is a Nolan film that does not over-complicate itself and is as good a science fiction thriller as I\'ve seen in many a year.', 'This mind-bending sci-fi masterpiece took me on an unforgettable journey through space and time. From its breathtaking visuals to the captivating performances, the film had me hooked from start to finish. I couldn\'t help but be inspired by its thought-provoking themes about love, sacrifice, and the boundless nature of human exploration. ""Interstellar"" truly left me in awe and is an absolute must-watch for any movie enthusiast.', 'What a cracker!\r\n\r\nSo glad to finally tick <em>\'Interstellar\'</em> off my theoretical list, took me far too long to get around to it but boy am I glad I finally have done - sensational film! The most obvious sign of that being the case is how the ~2hr30min run time goes by in an absolute flash... <em>*insert joke about it like being aboard Endurance here*</em>\r\n\r\nI\'m obviously not able to add anything new to what many, many others have already said gushingly about this 2014 flick, so I can only say I\'m sure I agree with the vast majority of whatever praise this has received. As one would expect from Christopher Nolan & Co., it\'s incredibly well made, sounds amazing and looks out-of-this-world (ha!) stunning.\r\n\r\nMatthew McConaughey puts in an incredible performance as lead, most notably nailing all of the emotion-filled scenes - not that I care about these things personally, but I\'m shocked to see the lack of high accolades that came his way from this... he merited more! Aside from him, there are very good showings from the likes of Jessica Chastain, Mackenzie Foy and Anne Hathaway.\r\n\r\nI will note one \'but\', mind. I didn\'t love the bits at the end involving the dimensional tesseract, don\'t get me wrong at all it\'s still superb viewing... just a noticeable drop from all that preceeds it, which honestly simply says more about how outstanding everything else prior is really. I thought similarly about (the equally magnificent) <em>\'<a href=""https://letterboxd.com/film/everything-everywhere-all-at-once/"" rel=""nofollow"">Everything Everywhere All at Once</a>\'</em>, for example. In short: just a nit-pick, tbh.\r\n\r\nAll in all, phenomenal!', 'Christopher Nolan\'s ""Interstellar"" (2014) isn\'t just a science fiction film; it\'s a cinematic experience that transcends genre boundaries. It\'s a breathtaking exploration of humanity\'s yearning for survival, the profound power of love, and the awe-inspiring mysteries of the universe.\r\n\r\nThe film\'s greatest strength lies in its seamless blend of a deeply personal story with cutting-edge scientific concepts. We follow Joseph Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a former pilot turned farmer, who is chosen to lead a mission to find a new home for humanity. The film doesn\'t shy away from complex scientific ideas like wormholes, black holes, and the theory of relativity, but it presents them in a way that is both accessible and captivating. The scene where Cooper encounters his aged daughter while he himself remains relatively young is a poignant example of how the film masterfully intertwines science and emotion, leaving viewers pondering the nature of time and the enduring power of familial bonds.\r\n\r\n""Interstellar"" is not for the casual viewer. It demands attention, patience, and a willingness to engage with complex ideas. The film\'s pacing is deliberate, its visuals are stunningly immersive, and its themes are profound. It\'s a film that rewards repeated viewings, as each watch unveils new layers of meaning and scientific detail. The film\'s impact is further amplified by Hans Zimmer\'s haunting score, which perfectly captures the vastness of space and the weight of humanity\'s fate.\r\n\r\nNolan\'s direction is masterful, creating a sense of awe and wonder that is both captivating and emotionally resonant. McConaughey delivers a nuanced performance as Cooper, a man grappling with the weight of his mission and the sacrifices he must make. The supporting cast, including Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, and Michael Caine, also deliver compelling performances that further elevate the film\'s emotional impact.\r\n\r\n""Interstellar"" is a film that stays with you long after the credits roll. It\'s a testament to the power of human ingenuity, the enduring nature of love, and the endless possibilities that lie beyond our planet. It\'s a film that reminds us of our place in the universe, and the profound interconnectedness of all things. For those who appreciate thought-provoking science fiction with a strong emotional core, ""Interstellar"" is an absolute must-see.', '""Interstellar"" is easily one of the best movies I’ve ever watched, definitely in my top 5 of all time. It’s a masterpiece that feels like every scene matters. Each moment carries an important message, whether it’s about love, sacrifice, or the endless curiosity of humans to explore the unknown. It’s not just a movie, it’s an experience.\r\n\r\nThe performances by the actors were amazing. Matthew McConaughey as Cooper really made me feel every bit of his emotions; his love for his kids, his struggle, and his determination to save humanity. Anne Hathaway also nailed her role, and Jessica Chastain, as adult Murph, was just perfect. Even the smaller roles added so much depth to the movie. It felt like everyone gave their absolute best.\r\n\r\nChristopher Nolan’s direction? Flawless. You can see how much thought and care he put into every part of the movie. The production was top-notch, and the visuals of space were breathtaking. Even the robots, TARS and CASE, felt real and practical, not just fancy CGI. Fun fact: those robots were real models controlled by an actor, which is crazy to think about! The black hole, Gargantua, was also scientifically accurate thanks to physicist Kip Thorne, and it looked stunning on screen.\r\n\r\nThe soundtrack by Hans Zimmer deserves its own shoutout. The way he used the church organ and ticking sounds created a mood that’s unforgettable. It felt like the music was alive and part of the story, pulling me deeper into every scene.\r\n\r\nThe movie also taught me things. I love how it’s based on real science, like time dilation and wormholes, but it doesn’t feel boring or like a science lesson. Instead, it made me curious and left me thinking long after it ended.\r\n\r\nOne thing that stood out for me is how the movie shows the power of love and connection. The relationship between Cooper and his daughter Murph was the heart of the story for me. It reminded me that even in the vastness of space, what truly matters are the people we care about.\r\n\r\n""Interstellar"" isn’t just about saving the world; it’s about what it means to be human. Watching it makes you think about big questions: Why are we here? What’s our purpose? And how far are we willing to go for the ones we love? It’s rare to find a movie that’s this entertaining, emotional, and thought-provoking all at the same time.\r\n\r\nThis is the kind of movie I could watch over and over again and still find new details to appreciate. It’s honestly hard to put into words how much I love it, but if you’ve seen it, you know what I mean. It’s a masterpiece that stays with you.']"

Great story line and a movie you can watch over and over again.', 'If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nDavid Fincher’s new film, Mank, is coming soon on Netflix, released six years after his latest installment, Gone Girl. Therefore, this week I’m reviewing five of Fincher’s movies. Se7en was the first one, and now it’s time for one of the most culturally impactful films of the 90s, Fight Club. This is another rewatch of another filmmaking classic, one that I was never able to absolutely adore like most people. When this movie came out in 1999, critics were extremely divided, and the film failed at the box office. With time, it gained a cult following through home media, but it’s still considered a very controversial piece of cinema. So, nothing new, having in mind Fincher is at the helm.\r\n\r\nDespite this being my third or fourth time experiencing this story, I never really changed my opinion about it, which is a bit uncommon in my viewing history. Usually, after multiple rewatches, my overall thoughts about a movie slightly vary, but Fight Club is one of the few exceptions. I believe my opinion remains intact from the very first watch. I really enjoy this film, but I can’t state that I absolutely love it. Since this is a special case, I’m going to start with what still bothers me after so many viewings, something I also rarely do in my reviews since I always leave the bad stuff to the end of the article.\r\n\r\nWithout spoiling anything, of course, there’s a vital plot twist that comes later in the movie that I could only appreciate by its execution, but never by its impact on the narrative. Jim Uhls’ screenplay relies on the main characters’ friendship to carry the story forward, and throughout the first two acts, Fincher leaves not-that-subtle hints to a massive revelation, which eventually triggers the beginning of the third act. This major plot point is brilliantly executed, and I still feel incredibly fascinated by its delivery, both in terms of the dialogue and the performances. However, its impact on any lightly focused, observant viewer is close to zero due to the clear evidence that pointed towards this development.\r\n\r\nNow, I don’t want to sound like that stereotypical moviegoer that says, “I guessed the twist before its revelation, hence it all sucks”. Like I insinuate above, I was still wholly captivated during the entirety of the third act. Nevertheless, Fight Club’s runtime is far from being short, and Fincher spends a lot of time building up an idea that loses its surprise factor even before the film’s midpoint. It changes the protagonist’s perspective, it takes the viewer through a predictable yet entertaining path, setting up a powerful, meaningful ending. However, personally, I don’t feel like the time spent in the first two acts was satisfyingly compensated in the end… at least, not in its entirety.\r\n\r\nThe second act also has a short period where it loses a bit of steam due to some repetitive sequences and an unnecessary amount of flashbacks. Again, I feel like Fincher didn’t completely trust the audience back then, contrary to his procedure in Se7en. In the latter flick, Fincher left the biggest responsibility to the viewer’s imagination, leaving the murder scenes for the audience to picture in their minds. In Fight Club, that ambiguity and implicit dialogue are still present, sure, but even before the third act, there’s already an attempt to explain too much certain portions of the narrative that I wish would stay vaguer.\r\n\r\nWithout spoiling anything, of course, there’s a vital plot twist that comes later in the movie that I could only appreciate by its execution, but never by its impact on the narrative.

In Fight Club, that ambiguity and implicit dialogue are still present, sure, but even before the third act, there’s already an attempt to explain too much certain portions of the narrative that I wish would stay vaguer.\r\n\r\nDon’t worry, I’m done with the negatives, and don’t forget: I really, really like this movie. Obviously, Fincher and Uhls created a story packed with underlying themes and social commentary. From the whole consumerism theory to the more psychological component regarding Edward Norton’s mental state, every message is seamlessly communicated to the audience. I’ve also been through a point in my life where I wish I’d be someone else, someone who had already achieved every dream of mine successfully with an overwhelming feeling of fulfillment. Coping with the inability to become that perfect someone can become an excruciating, sad, depressing process, and it varies drastically from person to person.\r\n\r\nFight Club approaches mental health and people’s acceptance of who they truly are in a groundbreaking manner, capturing Edward Norton’s emotions perfectly and broadcasting his thoughts through some of the best narration in the history of cinema. Its take on the world of consumerism is undoubtedly interesting and plays a big part in the climax of the film. Despite the issues described above, Uhls’ screenplay is very well-written, elevating the conversations between Norton and Brad Pitt (Ad Astra, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood), which are indeed remarkably entertaining. Predictable or not, the main story is wonderfully executed by Fincher, who continues to demonstrate his impressive technical attributes.\r\n\r\nOnce again, the pre-production phase is proved here to be as important as any other stage in the filmmaking process. Fincher’s dedication to his features is palpable and visible on-screen through every single technical aspect. This time, Fincher brought in Jeff Cronenweth as the director of photography, and both worked together to not only create that desaturated, realistic atmosphere that Fincher loves so much but also to deliver the brutal, violent, bloody fight scenes that keep the entertainment levels at their highest. With clean, consistent, coherent editing from James Haygood, the movie flows beautifully despite its lengthy runtime. The Dust Brothers’ score is quite alternative, which suits the also unconventional storytelling.\r\n\r\nLast but not least, Edward Norton and Brad Pitt. I know it’s incredibly cliche to write that two actors share impeccable chemistry, but Norton and Pitt take it to a whole other level. In two physically-demanding displays, both actors deliver award-worthy performances that marked their careers. Pitt offers one of his most underrated portrayals, being extremely funny throughout the entire film, but also astonishingly badass, carrying his fight sequences as amazing as he does with his dialogues. On the other hand, seeing Norton go all-out is a terrific experience. I lack words to describe such an emotionally compelling interpretation, filled with powerful character moments. A final word of praise to Helena Bonham Carter (Enola Holmes), who also delivers an exceptional performance.\r\n\r\nIn the end, Fight Club is and will probably remain David Fincher’s most controversial movie for a long, long time. With an absolutely brilliant direction and execution, Fincher uses Jim Uhls’ captivating, layered, unconventional screenplay to tackle themes such as consumerism, society’s behavior, and mental health, seamlessly transmitting meaningful yet contentious messages. Once again, the filmmaking in display is technically flawless, going from the trademark authentic cinematography and production design to the unique score, all flowing superbly through excellent editing. Unfortunately, I don’t belong to the group of people who utterly love this film. The excessive (sometimes unnecessary) use of flashbacks doesn’t help, but it’s the enormous build-up packed with overly explicit clues to a significant (yet unsurprising) plot twist that ends up partially ruining the viewing for me. I also wish that the script developed a few plot points more ambiguously, but Brad Pitt and Edward Norton elevate the whole movie so much with their ridiculously outstanding performances that these small issues don’t keep me away from highly recommending one of the most memorable, iconic films of all-time.\r\n\r\nRating: A-', ""I didn't enjoy this, pretty much at all, but still kinda appreciate how it all comes together. It's a weird one for me.\r\n\r\nOverall, <em>'Fight Club'</em> underwhelmed me. I actually knew very little before viewing it, despite hearing about it on a surface level for years and years; well, one 'regulatory' part of it anyway. It's much deeper than I had expected. Unfortunately, I didn't find entertainment with any of it - it was, to be honest, a slog to sit through.\r\n\r\nThe only scene I can remember enjoying is the very last one, and I don't mean that negatively because the end shot is terrific. It's just everything that comes before didn't do anything for me. Yet, I still rate its intentions. It did keep me guessing amidst my, near, boredom and the 'event' is a good one on paper. It just failed to connect on me in actuality.\r\n\r\nBrad Pitt is good as Tyler, though the likes of Edward Norton and Helena Bonham Carter give meh performances in my opinion. Meat Loaf is interesting, I guess, as Bob.\r\n\r\nI'm evidently in the extreme minority with my thoughts, each to their own, but I honestly didn't get into it sadly. As noted, though, I still partially rate it weirdly. 6* feels harsh, so I give it 7*."", 'I was mostly neutral on this movie until the last third, when things turned psychologically thrilling and gave me American Psycho vibes.

He’s finally inspired by an unconventional woman he meets at support groups (Helena Bonham Carter) and, especially, a devil-may-care guy who lives on the outskirts of town (Brad Pitt). They start an underground club where men get together and vent their frustrations by beating the crap out of each other.\r\n\r\n""Fight Club"" (1999) has a huge reputation as a stylish cult flick and is often ranked with the greatest films ever made. The first half is entertaining enough, both quirky and amusing; and I like the interesting themes explored: Escaping the maternal and material, being a slave to advertising, rebelling against life-stifling conformity, being a blind follower of a charismatic leader, finding your inner wild-man, Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Cool, the nature of lawless “revolutionaries” (which is too reminiscent of ANTIFA thugs), the struggle with homosexuality interpretation, etc. \r\n\r\nThat’s all highly commendable. Unfortunately, the second half isn’t compelling. I sat there bored and couldn’t wait for it to end. “Donnie Darko” (2001) had the same problem – promising set-up with clever ideas, but a tedious wrap-up. Meanwhile the twist that everyone gushes over is actually underwhelming and not very surprising, although it’s relatively interesting. \r\n\r\nMoreover, watching guys get radically beat up is only entertaining a couple times; after that it gets redundant. Speaking of which, how exactly does bare-knuckled fighting inspire or enlighten? Does it really help one’s life to have missing teeth, black eyes and other assorted injuries? Of course the movie doesn’t emphasize the long-lasting negative effects of regular brawling. Have you ever met a brawler, boxer or professional football player in his 50s with the perpetual aches & pains?\r\n\r\nCult flicks like “Pulp Fiction” (1994) deserve the praise and stand the test of time; this one disappoints mainly due to the curiously dull second half. But it\'s genius on the metaphorical level no doubt.\r\n\r\nThe film is overlong at 2 hours, 19 minutes, and was shot in Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-', ""Madness unbounded.  Don't try to make sense of insanity, just ride a wild ride."", ""The best movie i've seen, also my head hurts"", 'This is definitely one of the greatest movies of all time, stylistically, narratively, aesthetically, and creatively.\r\n\r\nIt uses very unorthodox camera angles, cute and effects to fully encapsulate this nihilistic, alternative culture that took over the late 90s and early 2000s.\r\n\r\nIt has very deep views on early corporate capitalism which really arose in the 90s, and it pulls no punches to deliver its beliefs on it. It’s very persuasive in its message about corporatism as it appeals directly to men’s natural instinct and rawness. It’s a very raw movie overall.\r\n\r\nMy only wish is that it could be longer. This movie SHOULD be 3 hours. But even then, it masterfully delivers an experience and segues beautifully into every scene, fulfilling every plot device and answering every question. There are no unleft answers with this movie, this movie is completely calculated and cold-hearted; much likes it main protagonist, Tyler Durden.\r\n\r\nAbsolutely watch this movie!', 'I wonder just how much of this might have been inspired by the vivid imagination of Robert Louis Stevenson? Edward Norton narrates a story that\'s essentially about himself. He works nine-to-five, but can\'t sleep. He can\'t explain his insomnia and after a casual aside from his doctor - who refuses to prescribe him sedatives - he starts cruising evening support groups. That\'s when he meets two important people. The first is ""Bob"" (Meat Loaf) who has undergone some hormone therapy that inadvertently helps him cry. Now after a bit of hugging, that skill transfers to our storyteller and the weeping seems to help with the sleeping! Success... Next, he meets ""Marla"" (Helena Bonham Carter) who also spends her evening going from group to group. Her only illness is a penchant for free doughnuts and coffee. They sort of bond - and even agree to divvy up the groups so they don\'t clash! It\'s on a flight, though, that our friend finds his life profoundly altered. He sits next to the uber-confident soap maker ""Tyler Durden"" (Brad Pitt) who offers him an whole new take on life - especially when his condo inexplicably blows up and he finds himself living with his new friend in what looks like a glorified squat. ""Punch me"" requires his pal. He gets punched back and both now seem to thrive on the ensuing and rather brutal cycle of violence. Their relationship feeds off the beatings and swiftly they are recruiting other men to their ""Fight Club"". With shades of the bare-knuckled boxing of the 19th century, they are soon atop an ever-growing group of men who almost revere their leaders. It\'s here that the whole story heads a little off-piste as it becomes clear that there is a much more malevolent agenda being put together by the membership. ""Durden"" starts to freeze out his friend, and now feeling more and more isolated his mental state starts to worsen. Just what\'s going on? Who is who? Even ""Marly"" starts to think he\'s lost the plot. This film is an allegorists wet dream. Just about every aspect of the characters behaviour can be used to evaluate or demonstrate  choices, freedoms, rebellion, self-awareness - even love. It\'s not quite so difficult to guess what the denouement will deliver, but it\'s a journey filled with violence (who\'d be Jared Leto?), but it\'s increasingly used more as if it were a steam valve for something much more psychologically demanding. It\'s got to be Norton\'s best effort yet and with Pitt charismatically vacillating between the sagely and the thoroughly evil, this is thought-provoking cinema that is certainly better to watch in a cinema if you can.']"

Mixed into this web is a private investigator (Martin Balsam), Marion’s sister (Vera Miles) and Marion’s secret beau (John Gavin).\r\n\r\nDirected by Alfred Hitchcock based on Robert Bloch’s book, “Psycho” made a huge impact when it was released in 1960. It contains a plot development that was groundbreaking at the time shared by England’s “City of the Dead” (aka “Horror Hotel”), which went into production six weeks earlier than “Psycho” and was released in the UK at the same time, but not in America until 2 years later. While they’re both good, “Psycho” is way superior.

Only Alfred Hitchcock could make a film so entertaining and so horrifying at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe climax continues to haunt me forever.', 'Amazingly, this is my first ever viewing, not sure why I waited so long, but finally got around to it. Great movie in every way from the performance by Anthony Perkins to the atmosphere, enjoyed every bit of this even though I basically knew the entire plot at this point since all iconic scenes and lines have been repeated over the years. Not sure this is my *favorite* Hitchcock movie as I still prefer Rear Window, but obvious why it has held up 60 years later. **4.5/5**', 'There is so much more to this film than just that famous scene in the shower - and so much of it belongs to the marvellous scoring of Bernard Herrmann. His ability to use those screeching strings, and the pace of his music does so much of the heavy lifting that gives this film a sense of accumulating menace that makes it still, after over 60 years, a masterful piece of cinema. Janet Leigh wants to make a go of things with her cash-strapped hunky boyfriend ""Sam"" (John Gavin) so when an unexpected opportunity arises at work that puts $40,000 in her lap, she skips town and takes refuge during a thunderstorm at the ""Bates"" motel where she encounters ""Norman"" (a very handsome looking Anthony Perkins). The rest you will just have to watch for yourself, but the story has just about everything you could want from a thriller: a fella with a bit of a ""mummy"" syndrome; some good old fashioned larceny; lust and though I didn\'t quite love the ending, it is a superbly dramatic piece of well considered and constructed cinema that cleverly builds on what is quite a simple story with a strong and convincing cast. Big screen if you can; that house on the hill looks more eery that way. Great stuff!']"

It’s gruelling too, the 18 rating is due to the thread running through the film of continuous and ruthless violence of gangs trying to control their drug area. The is the story told through the eyes of ‘Rocket’ who avoids getting in to the gang war of his brother and friends by trying to find a safer life. \r\n\r\nThe film combines slick production without losing a genuine documentary feel which I think it is why it’s so enduring. While it achieves a feeling of reality, it isn’t specifically a true story. However, the Cidade de Deus is real (being created to rehouse the slums away from Rio de Janeiro) and this story of its underworld and the film’s production makes one believe it may not be too far from the truth. There is hope in the story but not a lot.', 'Told by way of an occasionally narrated retrospective, ""Rocket"" (Alexandre Rodrigues) tells us a story of his childhood in the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro. Growing up in a community of newly built boxes, without power or plumbing, that reminded me of a row of concrete beach huts, the community is pretty lawless. The crime is largely to confined to pettier crimes, but as aspirations grow so does the scale of the criminality. A raid on a motel-cum-brothel is supposed to make everyone extra cash, but their inventive young watchman ""Li\'l Dice"" (Douglas Silva) hates being left out and so does a little augmenting of his own. Brutal and attention grabbing. Next the cops crack down, bodies pile up and the societal order starts to change. It\'s this young man who grows up into the leading drug-peddling hoodlum amongst a now much more developed township where, tempered only by his more diplomatic childhood friend ""Bené"" (Phellipe Haagensen), the newly named ""Li\'l Zé"" (Leandro Firmino) is ruling the roost. Curiously, his own form of government proves more stable for the residents, and although many are addicts there is a certain degree of law-and-order. Then the runts start to intervene. These are the young children with no hope, no families and only the dream of becoming their own version of ""Li\'l Zé"" one day too. Gradually, the empire expands until it\'s only ""Carrot"" (Matheus Nachtergaele) who stands against him. When tragedy strikes very close to home for the kingpin, though, the uneasy peace between the two sections breaks out into an open warfare that drags in the sharpshooting army vet ""Knockout Ned"" (Seu Jorge), arms all the enthusiastic children and creates an environment that isn\'t safe for anyone - and where the police keep their distance in the hope that they will just all just slaughter each other. It\'s lucky that ""Rocket"" can use a camera. His boss wants publicity to illustrate how dominant and powerful he is. The newspapers want the photographs too. If the young man can walk the tightrope carefully, he might find himself well placed to capitalise on his unique access to a story that by now is gripping their nation. This is a fascinatingly well put together depiction of the worst of human nature; a dog eat dog world, where traditional humanity is scarce and the virtues of a not so benign dictatorship are exposed for all to see. The characterisations are mostly brutal and exploitative, yet there is a place for love and loyalty too amidst a poverty stricken population that craves basics like food and running water and is oblivious to death in the streets. The story is well supplemented by some engaging supporting characters like ""Steak n\' Fries"", ""Goose"", ""Shaggy"" and ""Thiago"" (Daniel Zettel or is it really Timothée Chalamet?). The writing delivers powerfully but sparingly. We don\'t have loads of waffling dialogue, and there\'s also quite a bit of dark humour contained to not so much lighten the mood as to enhance the perception amongst most of the population that kill or be killed was a perfectly reasonable mantra. Firmino, Haagensen and Rodrigues deliver extremely well here in this most impressively photographed and intense look at a society where the top dog was only top by feeding and starving his followers. It\'s not especially graphic, I found, just a poignant look at survival of the fittest, the shrewdest and the luckiest. There\'s also a distinct lack of religiosity throughout, too! If you can see this at a cinema, then do - it\'s based on a true story and isn\'t an easy watch.']"

This film is one of them: I was really shocked to find that it wasn\'t even nominated for an Oscar or a Golden Globe… and I had to read a bit to understand why that happened.\r\n\r\nThe film is perhaps one of the best in Sérgio Leone\'s extensive filmography, and is often compared to other great gangster films such as ""Godfather"". I, personally, wouldn\'t dare to do that, but I could still put this film in the “top ten” of the great mobster films. Amazingly, it was a huge box office failure in the US because they insisted on releasing there an extremely cut version, with about two and a half hours. A version so forgettable and badly edited that no one understood the story and that the film had no chance of running for the highest awards in the industry! It was a shot in the foot and proves the importance of a good edition for the quality of the product. Sometimes a longer film is preferable to a sterile, abridged version.\r\n\r\nThe script is wonderful and follows the criminal path of a small group of youngsters from a Jewish community in New York, stretching from the 20s to the 60s. The story revolves around Noodles, but the main character ends up being Max, who becomes the gang\'s boss. The relationship between them is very well explored. However, not everything went well: there is a love sub-plot between Noodles and Deborah that is never taken further, there are several characters that seem too sketchy and underdeveloped and there are situations that the film doesn\'t know how to explore as it should (the most glaring being the violent death of the youngest gang member). I just can\'t say how many of these problems started in the editing room, with radical cuts in the story told.\r\n\r\nRobert DeNiro was one of the first names to be hired for the cast, and had a say in the choice of several other actors. DeNiro is impeccable, and he provides us with excellent quality work. Moreover, I think that this helped to glue the actor\'s image a little to the criminal films in the popular imagination, along with “Taxi Driver” and “Goodfellas”. James Woods is also amazing in the role he has been given and leaves with this film his greatest film work. Elizabeth McGovern also does very well here, although I feel that the actress was not able to make her career take off afterward (I only saw her really successful now, with “Downton Abbey”). I also liked the brief, but remarkable, participation of Jennifer Connelly, still very young. And I feel sorry for Joe Pesci, because the actor is wasted by appearing only in a couple of scenes (perhaps another victim of the radical cuts in the editing room).\r\n\r\nLeone uses everything he knows in this film and provides us with incredible, beautiful cinematography, which knows how to take advantage of slow camera movements, close-ups in the most striking scenes and intense colors. The flashbacks are quite well-marked, and anyone familiar with the cinematic resource will have no difficulty in following the temporal advances and retreats that take place. The special effects do their job well, the costumes are excellent, and the characterization has its moments (DeNiro has been masterfully aged, and very much resembles what he is today). As a film where crime and violence are things we expect to find, we have an array of violent scenes and graphic situations that include not only brutal murders, beatings and shootings but also teen sex, voyeurism and, most notably, a long and particularly graphic rape scene. It\'s not a movie for the faint-hearted. A final word for the soundtrack, by Ennio Morricone. It is highly regarded by connoisseurs and I admit it works, but I\'m not a fan of the pan pipe. I feel it gives the film an oriental touch, it would be something I would expect more from a martial arts film soundtrack.', 'Told by way of a really potent (and well scored by Morricone) retrospective, this sits us down and takes us through a forty year period in the life of the now down-at-heel ""Noodles"" (Robert De Niro) and of the development of the city of New York. The contents of an old briefcase serve as an aide memoire as the retrospective illustrates just how he and three of his childhood friends decided that the gutter was not for them, and that using the ""system"" to get on was the only way. Prohibition, violence, crime, brutality were the currency back then and ""Noodles"" learned not to have scruples about such things. Love, romance feature too - choices, compromises and tragedy all feature as Sergio Leone and De Niro immerses us in the characterful and emotionally charged chronology. The film looks great, the attention to detail is superb, and a really strong supporting cast help offer us s sense that we are actually there for much of the time. Living and breathing the squalor, the danger, the opportunity and perhaps, the inevitability, of the paths these kids took in a the 1930s. It is very long, but that\'s effective rather than dull. It allows the characters to develop, to breathe and then to disappear - only, perhaps, to reappear in a different guise later on. Ageing is also a factor here too - just as they rose, others rise too with differing standards and ethics - their sense of loyalty and integrity not quite marrying up! No Oscar nominations which is really rather odd - this is easily one of the best, most authentic-looking, depictions of the rise of NYC that cinema has ever delivered. Director\'s cut on a big screen if you can - it helps focus the attention, shows the cinematography to best effect and helps appreciate just how vast Leone\'s vision was.']"

This statement is worthy of investigation for several reasons.\r\n\r\nFellowship is indeed merely an opening salvo, and even after three hours in the dark you will likely exit the cinema ravenous with anticipation for the further two parts of the trilogy. Fellowship is also unabashedly rooted in the fantasy genre. Not to be confused with the techno-cool of good science fiction, nor even the cutesy charm of family fare like Harry Potter, the territory of Tolkien is clearly marked by goo and goblins and gobbledegook. Persons with an aversion to lines such as, “To the bridge of Khazad-dûm!” are as well to stay within the Shire-like comforts of home (their loss).\r\n\r\nWith those caveats in place, it bears repeating: fantasy does not come finer. There are electrifying moments — notably the computer-assisted swooping camera through Isengard as it transforms into a factory for evil — when Jackson’s flight of fancy approaches the sublime as the romantic poets would understand it: inspiring awe.\r\n\r\nLeaving aside the thorny issue of Tolkien die-hards and their inevitable gripes — “What no Tom Bombadil?” — Jackson’s screenplay (written in collaboration with Fran Walsh and Phillipa Boyens) is both bolder and more judicious than Steven Kloves’ surprisingly timid retread of Harry Potter. In particular, rescuing the romance of Arwen and Aragorn from the footnotes and the elevation of Saruman to all-action bad guy actually has a corrective influence on Tolkien’s often oblique and female-sparse source material.\r\n\r\nThere are problems, though. The three-hour running time is high on incident and low on discernible form. After successive detours to Elf habitats Rivendell (the watery home of Elrond) and Lothlórien (the forest home of the Lady Galadriel), the uninitiated might well ask why these crazy Elf kids can’t just live together and spare us all this attenuated dramatic structure.\r\n\r\nMore importantly, the action clearly climaxes in the desperate flight from the Mines Of Moria, where the largely seamless SFX is showcased in the best possible light — total darkness — but the narrative demands a different, downbeat ending. Indeed, but for some fine emotional playing from Bean, Mortensen, Astin and Wood, the final fight might feel like a particularly brutal game of paintball in Bluebell Wood. But then, the real battles are yet to come...\r\n\r\n\r\nVerdict - Putting formula blockbusters to shame, Fellowship is impeccably cast and constructed with both care and passion: this is a labour of love that never feels laboured. Emotional range and character depth ultimately take us beyond genre limitations, and it deserves to play as wide as a certain Mr. Potter.\r\n\r\n5/5\r\n\r\n- Colin Kennedy, Empire Magazine', 'An epic movie if I ever saw one. Captivating and just plain fun to watch. This movie is, indeed, art.', 'Tolkien’s adventure/fantasy LOOKS and SOUNDS fabulous, but is not without flaws.\r\n\r\nRELEASED 2001 and directed by Peter Jackson, “The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring” adapts the first part of JRR Tolkien’s popular fantasy trilogy about adventures on Middle-Earth. The story starts in the homeland of the Hobbits (innocent, diminutive humanoids) where Frodo (Elijah Wood) is instructed by the noble wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) to quickly leave the Shire with the powerful One Ring in his possession. Gandalf and Frodo are later accompanied by seven others, the titular ‘Fellowship of the Ring,’ to take the ring to the only place it can be destroyed, the fires of Mount Doom in Mordor. \r\n\r\nThe rest of the main cast include Sean Astin (Sam), Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn), Sean Bean (Boromir), Christopher Lee (Saruman), Orlando Bloom (Legolas), John Rhys-Davies (Gimli) and Hugo Weaving (Elrond).        \r\n\r\nThis three-hour fantasy features a diverse cast of colorful characters, quaint beings and settings, moments of genuine wonder, dark ee-vil creatures, high adventure, thrilling brutal action, a superb score, magnificent locations (forests, mountains, rivers, etc.), and wondrous CGI sets. The film LOOKS and SOUNDS so great that it’d be sinful to give it a lower rating. \r\n\r\nThere are problems, however, at least for those who aren’t uber-fans of Tolkien. For one, the opening is hindered by prologue that is overlong and convoluted, not to mention unnecessary. The bulk of it could’ve been conveyed later via flashback, which they do a little bit anyway. Secondly, the story takes forever to build any drive. Thirdly, except for maybe Frodo and Gandalf, the characters are shallow and I didn’t care much what happened to them. Fourthly, main protagonists getting seriously wounded and everyone else expressing their melodramatic concern gets redundant.  \r\n\r\nFifthly, there are only two females in the main cast (Liv Tyler as Arwen, a half-Elf princess, and Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, a royal Elf); unfortunately, their parts aren’t much more than glorified cameos. “Mythica: A Quest for Heroes” (2014) cost LESS THAN $100,000 to make, which is a mere fraction of the $93 million it cost to make this blockbuster and the filmmakers knew enough to include a couple of prominent babes as key protagonists in the story. \r\n\r\nDespite these negatives, “The Fellowship of the Ring” is the best of the trilogy and is a must for fantasy/adventure aficionados, especially Tolkien fans.                      \r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours 58 minutes and was shot in New Zealand. \r\n\r\nGRADE: B/B- (6.5/10)', ""Overall, I give this four stars.  Not five, because some of the changes really bug me, as a long-time Tolkien fan, but a solid four.  \r\n\r\nThe casting, to start, was brilliant.  Sean Astin was the absolute perfect choice for Sam, and did a remarkable job bringing that character to life for us.  He really WAS Sam, in this role, in a very deep way.  I always liked his acting, but here, he showed how talented he actually is.  Just amazing.  Elijah Wood gives a great performance of Frodo, and those expressive eyes of his really add a lot of depth to the emotions the character goes through, which are such an important part of the story.  Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan both did great work, for our other two main hobbits.  Their smiles, their singing; just every aspect of these characters was so real.  Viggo Mortensen, of course, was excellent.  He's always good, and though I never would have pictures him as Aragorn, he delivered everything we could hope for.  Great choice for that role!  John Rhys-Davies, as expected, gave us the Gimli we wanted.  Phenomenal actor, and I can't imagine anyone doing that role better.  Orlando Bloom plays a convincing Legolas, and handles the nuances of being an elf quite well.  Sean Bean as Boromir was outstanding, bringing the strength of that character to life, and making us love him.  Then we have Ian McKellen, as Gandalf.  I could never have chosen someone for that role, but the casting folks hit a home run with this one.  Everything about his character was just right.  Literally everything.  I can't read the books without seeing these people in these roles now.  The rest of the cast ws good as well.\r\n\r\nThen we have the setting.  New Zealand has to have some of the most utterly gorgeous scenery on the planet.  Seeing it in these movies was great, and convincingly Middle Earth, and seeing more since, in other videos, just WOW!  Thanks, to the people of New Zealand, for allowing this to be filmed there!  \r\n\r\nThe sets were just fantastic.  Everything looked as good as I'd always hoped it would look, with all the charm, mystery, and wonder  Tolkien fan could hope for.  From Bag end to Rivendell to the vastness of \r\nMiddle Earth, everything we saw was just right.  \r\n\r\nThe only issues I had were some of the changes.  Yes, I know things don't always work in movies as they do in books, but when whole sections are just omitted, that bothers me.  It's not like the movies weren't long already!  That omitted section, with which Tolkien fans will be quite familiar, was a very important part of the plot!  I also didn't care for some of the other changes, and the way Arwen was used, the scene at the river being one example.  \r\n\r\nAll in all, though, this was a well done movie, and even though some things bug me, this film, and the rest of the series, will be viewed many times.  Classics, worth collecting and treasuring."", 'Lost count how many times I\'ve seen the ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" but still fantastic after all these years, epic on every level and just all around entertaining, the 3.5 running time just flies by. Will be watching ""The Two Towers"" either tonight or tomorrow followed by ""The Return of the King"". **4.75/5**', 'Well, I wouldn’t read this review if you are a true fan of fantasy adventure epics, because I am not. Don’t get me wrong, I like this movie and have watched it a few times over the years, but I have watched  (or read, for that matter) very little else in the fantasy  genre. I didn’t get too far into the Game of Thrones as the violent rapes got old for me fast. \r\n\r\nSo I watched this first entry of the Lord of the Rings trilogy as just a viewer, not a fan, and I liked it just fine. The complex plot held together well and the scenery was gorgeous. There was violence, but not gore, and for those who don’t like war movies, there wasn’t as much of it here as there is in the other two films of the trilogy.\r\n\r\nI gather the elfin roles for women were enlarged and brought to the fore, and why not; women were mostly good for setting mead and large pieces of rare meat down on tables in front of their warrior men.\r\n\r\nI must confess, I found it jarring that the warriors like Strider were so invincible, walking into a horde of sixty orcs and scattering them like toy soldiers with his sword. I know they are epic heroes, but if I’m an orc, I stand back and throw something or whatever, but it is similar to the old legends with semi-gods like Achilles, back when Hector was a pup.\r\n\r\nI am not going to compare the film to the book — I read it decades ago when I was in high school. It is worth watching and though real fans will take this with a large grain of salt, I think it is possibly the definitive adaptation of the book. (I need to watch the other two entries in the series before I say the same about those.) if you are among the 12% percent of movie goers who haven’t seen it, give it a try.', ""Magnificent! A great start to the franchise.\r\n\r\n<em>'The Lord of the Rings'</em> is yet another film series that I am incredibly late to viewing, at least I've finally got around to it... albeit almost twenty years on from this film's release.\r\n\r\n<em>'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'</em> is delightful. I never know what to expect from a film that goes on for nearly three hours, the pacing has to be near perfection for it to work - and boy does it here. The run time flew by, which is always a terrific sign.\r\n\r\nI love a load of things about this, the one that actually sticks out most is the outstanding score. Music can play a huge part in how much I enjoy a film, so I'm delighted to say that the score is here is fantastic. That is by no means the only positive, obviously.\r\n\r\nThe cast are excellent. Elijah Wood gives a strong performance in the lead role. I've seen Wood in others things down the years and have actually found him a bit hit-and-miss, but here he is very good. Elsewhere, I really enjoyed watching Viggo Mortensen's character.\r\n\r\nAway from those two, there are a whole host of noteworthy cast members. Orlando Bloom, or Will Turner to me, is involved, as are the likes of Ian McKellen and Sean Bean. I also liked Liv Tyler in her role.\r\n\r\nThe look of the film is spectacular, and has aged extremely well even to this day. Everything from the cinematography to the costumes is brilliant, those two things really make the film come alive - helped by the aforementioned score, of course.\r\n\r\nVery eager to check out the sequels, prequels and, eventually, the upcoming television series."", 'This film may be perfect.\r\nBased on the fantasy world written by Tolkien, we see the halfling hobbits, the most unlikely of heroes, a breed of human type beings who indulge in pleasures, games, and fun, and do little evil.\r\nIn the same world are more powerful beings, some good, like the elves and wizards, some evil, like the orcs, trolls, and dragons, and some in between, like the dwarves and men.\r\nAnd one evil super being, Sauron, the second in command to the ""devil"" of this world called Middle Earth, and that devil called Melkor is now in chains and powerless, so Sauron rules all evil.\r\nThat said, we get a very faithful version to the book, only improved. This is the first of three segments called ""The Lord of the Rings"". The parts left out are parts best left out. Tom Bombadil, for example, along with his wife, represents a very Hitler like Aryan ideology of supremacy that Tolkien often engaged in. \r\nThe film begins with a narrative and action sequence that is awesome, and then goes into the ""status quo"" setting of the ""shire"" of hobbits, much like the status quo setting of films like ""Women of Dolwyn"".\r\nFrom there, we get an amazing story of four hobbits who embark on a journey of utmost importance, joined by a wizard, an elf, a dwarf, and two men.\r\nThe direction is stunning. The motivation even better explained than in the Tolkien books. This is a masterpiece.', 'So now that the picture houses across the UK are beginning to reopen, this is the third film I\'ve settled down to watch in front of a huge big screen - and it\'s a belter. You can only wonder at the sheer imagination of JRR Tolkien and of Peter Jackson, Fran Walsh & Philippa Boyens as they adeptly adapt this epic tale of power for a new generation. Certainly, it over-hams the accents - maybe just a few too many ""rrrs"" in ""Arrragorrrrn"" but otherwise it\'s a feast for senses. When the hairy-footed Hobbit ""Bilbo"" (Sir Ian Holm) gets to eleventy-one he sets off to write his life-story with the elves. He leaves his possessions - including a mysterious ring - to Frodo (Elijah Wood). When visiting wizard ""Gandalf"" (Sir Ian McKellen) identifies it as the epitome of wickedness that puts all of their lives are in danger, ""Frodo"" and his lifelong friend ""Sam"" (Sean Astin) must flee their bucolic happiness. This first instalment of the trilogy tracks the journey of the hobbits as they meet ""Stryder"" (Viggo Mortensen) and together try to evade the pursuing wraith attempting to get to ""Elrond"" the Elvish king in ""Rivendell"" and decide what is best to do with this evil, seemingly indestructible talisman. Their only solution proves to be returning the ring to the lava-filled cavern of ""Mount Doom"" where it was forged: only there can it\'s corruption be defeated. The brave hobbits, together with two men, an elf and a dwarf set out to accomplish this all but impossible task fighting the weather, evil orcs, malevolent magic and the harsh terrain on their treacherous way. It\'s the ultimate fantasy adventure; that sticks to the spirit, if not to every word, of the original work. The effects both in make-up and from the computer are expertly applied creating a real sense of tension and peril that compliments, rather than subsumes, the actual action and beautiful cinematography of the New Zealand scenery through which our intrepid gang must travel. This is probably the weakest of the three episodes as it takes a good hour to get going; but once it does and the ""Fellowship"" takes firmer form with a superb John Howard-Davies; a handsome Orlando Bloom and even the usually wooden Sean Bean raises his game to give us as a truly cracking, at times quite scary adventure that is magnificently scored by the inspired Howard Shore. This is not really a film that works on the telly - however large the screen may be. To do justice to the creativity of all concerned it just has to be given the respect it deserves and be seen in the cinema. If you get a chance, you should go see it (again!).']"

Nicholson shines in his best performance and is ably supported by Christopher Lloyd, Brad Dourif and Danny DeVito."", '***The spirit of freedom vs. the spirit of legal-ism***\r\n\r\nSet in the early 60s, the story involves R.P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) and his arrival at a mental institution in Salem, Oregon (where the film was shot). He plays the ""mental illness"" card to get out of prison time, thinking it\'ll be a piece of cake, but he\'s wrong, very wrong. Everything appears well at the hospital and Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) seems to be a benevolent overseer of McMurphy\'s ward, but there are sinister things going on beneath the surface.\r\n\r\n""One Flew Over the Cuckoo\'s Nest"" (1975) is a film you\'ll appreciate more as you mature. I saw it when I was younger and, while I thought it was good, I didn\'t \'get\' a lot of the insights the film conveys.\r\n\r\nThe movie criticizes the way institutions deal with mental illnesses. Their ""therapy"" is futile and only makes the patients dependent on the institution itself, thereby creating its need for existence (often at the taxpayer\'s expense). McMurphy is a threat to the establishment and therefore must be ""dealt with.""\r\n\r\nA lot of people criticize the film by suggesting that Nurse Ratched ""isn\'t that bad"" or that ""she was only trying to do her job"", etc. I had the same reaction the first couple of times I saw it. This reveals an aspect of the film\'s brilliance: Ratched\'s malevolence is so subtle that the filmmakers allow the possibility for complete misinterpretation. Yes, from an administrative point of view, she seemingly does a good job, she\'s authoritarian without being sadistic, and she cares for the residents as long as they follow the rules (more on this below). Yet she is demonic as a robotized arm of a dehumanizing system. She maintains the residents in a state of oblivion and marginalization; they are deprived of their dignity because the system sees them as subhuman.\r\n\r\nThe filmmakers and Fletcher (not to mention the author of the book, Ken Kesey) make Nurse Ratched a more effective antagonist by showing restraint. Compare her to, say, Faye Dunaway\'s portrayal of Joan Crawford in ""Mommie Dearest,"" which pretty much turned her into a cartoon villain. Ratched isn\'t such an obvious sadist, yet she uses the rules to tyrannize the men and reduce them to an almost infantile state of dependency and subservience. Her crowning achievement is Billy Bibbit (Brad Dourif).\r\n\r\nMcMurphy, despite his obvious flaws, is the protagonist of the story. Although he\'s impulsive and has a weakness for the female gender, which got him into prison in the first place, he has a spirit of freedom and life. His problem is that he needs to learn a bit of wisdom; then he can walk in his freedom without causing unnecessary harm to himself and others.\r\n\r\nNurse Ratched, on the other hand, represents legal-ism, which is an authoritarian spirit obsessed with laws or rules. This is clearly seen in the World Series sequence: Even though McMurphy gets the final vote he needs for his ward to watch the Series Ratched refuses to allow it on a technicality. When McMurphy then PRETENDS to watch the game and works the guys up into a state of euphoria, Ratched reacts with sourpuss disapproval. That\'s because legalism is the opposite of the spirit of freedom, life and joy. Legalism is all about putting on appearances and enforcing the LETTER of the law (rule). The problem with this is that ""appearances"" are not about inward reality and, worse, ""the letter kills.""\r\n\r\nDespite his folly and mistakes, McMurphy does more good for the guys in his ward than Ratched and the institution could do in a lifetime. How so? Not only because he has a spirit of freedom and life, but because he loves deeply, but only those who deserve it – the humble – not arrogant abusers. When you cast restraint to the wind and love with all your heart you\'ll reap love in return, as long as the person is worthy. A certain person hugs McMurphy at the end because he loves him. McMurphy set him free from the shackles of mental illness and, worse, the institution that refuses to actually heal because it needs mentally ill people to exist; it only goes through the motions of caring and healing (not that there aren\'t any good people in such institutions, of course).\r\n\r\nNo review of this film is complete without mentioning the notable character of “Chief” Bromden, played effectively by Will Sampson.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours and 13 minutes.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A', '_One Flew Over The Cuckoo\'s Nest_ tells the story of a criminal, Randle Patrick McMurphy (Jack Nicholson), who pleads insanity in the attempt to get a more lenient sentence. Sent to a mental hospital, he livens up the otherwise monotonous lives of the patients, much to the ire of the strict head nurse, Mildred Ratched (Louise Fletcher).\r\n\r\n_One Flew Over The Cuckoo\'s Nest_ clean swept the Oscars in 1976, taking home the five biggest prizes as only the second film to do so since It Happened One Night.\r\n\r\nIn reality, it is an extremely frustrating film. Pitched as a ""man against the system"", McMurphy is clearly written to be chaotic and bring some colour to the otherwise black and white world of the hospital. Meanwhile, Ratched is the oppressive villain sticking regimentally to routine despite the suffering of the patients.\r\n\r\nIn actuality, the opposite appears true. While McMurphy is disruptive, he often comes across as a bully, coercing the patients against their will. Even as he gains some of their trust, he continues to manipulate until he has a majority behind him. Ratched on the other hand is the voice of reason. While the medical practices are undeniably oppressive by modern standards, she remains cool, calm and collected at all times when dealing with her patients.\r\n\r\nThat being said, Nicholson does give a career defining performance, fully deserving of his Academy Award. It is often his body language or subtle facial expressions that betray the mischief of McMurphy, and these human qualities cannot be expressed in a script. He switches from the chaos and disorder of a profanity-ridden baseball commentary to the benign friendship of some of his fellow interns with consummate professionalism.\r\n\r\nHe leads an all-star cast including both Danny DeVito and Christopher Lloyd, but the other standout is debutant Brad Dourif as the stuttering and immature Billy Bibbit. And, whenever the film veers towards bedlam, it is Louise Fletcher - who reportedly took on the role while other bigger names in Hollywood declined it for fear of being cast as the villain - who brings it back to earth with strong and capable acting.\r\n\r\nOverall, a mixed bag. Fortunately, the weak characters are more than carried by the superb story and acting.']"

A somewhat ethnocentric attitude, more typical of small minds. For a long time, the Japanese were a people divided by several feudal princes who fought among themselves, disputing power and regional influence. It was in this context, moreover, that the first contact between the Japanese and the Portuguese took place, the first Westerners to disembark, demonstrably (Marco Polo speaks of the Japanese, but he probably never went there), on the islands of Japan, where they took the first firearm, the Christian faith and a strong cultural influence: even today, in the Japanese language, there are hundreds of words directly imported from Portuguese.\r\n\r\nThe film that brought me here tells us about one of the most fascinating traditional figures of Japan: the samurai, a warrior similar, in essence, to the European knight. They were educated people who were willing to live off the war, as paid mercenaries. In a land where each feudal lord wages war for himself, with his own troops and against his neighbors, it was not difficult to live off war. It would be difficult to live in peace! The samurai had a code of conduct, the Bushido, which dictated rules according to which they guided their lives, seeking to live and die with honor. Honor was more important than life and therefore, in certain situations, it was expected that the samurai knew how to die and was willing to do so, even if by his own hands, in a suicide ritual.\r\n\r\nThe film begins when a samurai, left unemployed by a long peace, turns to an old man and asks to be allowed to die. In response, he hears a story that occurred some time before, and in which a samurai in the same situation made an identical request in the expectation of receiving money, and ended up having to commit suicide, and with a wooden weapon. The film then reveals an important fact: this first samurai is the father-in-law of the man who killed himself, and who wanted money to feed his sick wife and son. And in fact that warrior is not there in order to simply die, but in order to avenge the son-in-law wronged by human hypocrisy.\r\n\r\nThe film is quite dense, and the fact that it is so different from Western cinema and, even more so, in black and white, can quite scare the current public. However, it is worth resisting this impulse to reject it and giving the film a chance. It's very well done, it has a pretty good story, which is nothing behind big Hollywood hits. The script takes advantage of the situation to expose the brutality of the rigor imposed on the samurai by means of a moral code so absurdly demanding that it ended up being inhumane. Contrary to what happens in some films, even western ones, this film does a good historical contextualization of the story it tells us, not being too difficult to understand what is at stake. I'm not the best person to talk about the director or the actors, I don't know them, but I can say that we have the participation of Tatsuya Nakadai, Yoshiro Aoki and Akira Ishihama. On a technical level, I think it's impossible to avoid noticing the quality of the sets and filming locations, as well as the sharpness and quality of the cinematography.""]"

The animation in this film is styled to look like an actual comic book. I think this approach for this kind of film was an excellent choice because we’ve all seen the usual kind of animation but nothing like this. To tie in with the animation I need to talk about the action scenes in this film. These tie in with the animation because of the way the directors styled the action shots is to look like something in a comic panel. Most people don’t know who Miles Morales is and after this film, you’ll want to learn more about him because of how they made him so relatable in this film. He acts like a typical teen in this situation compared to other versions of Spider-Man. Other versions kind of just acted like they always knew how to use their powers when Miles struggles with his. Miles isn’t the only relatable character film all of them are. The creators of this film did a “Marvel”ous job at making each character in this film somebody at least one person in the audience can relate to. All of the voice actors did a great job in their respected roles but it would’ve been nice to have a returning voice to at least one of the Spider-Man. It would’ve been cool to hear a returning voice even if it was for a few seconds. I have to talk about the humour in this film. It isn’t overpowered in this film and I felt like it had just the right amount of humour that will make everybody laugh. They poke fun of things that wouldn’t make sense in a real movie and other Spider-Man movies. Not a single moment in this film felt rushed or slowed down every scene felt the right pace for a movie like this. The cinematography in this movie was spectacular. This is probably because of it looking like a comic book and how the lighting needs to match up with how it would look in an actual book. If you are a comic book junkie you’ll love all of the easter eggs in this film. Some of them just comic book readers will get but others a majority of people will understand. The music in this film is fantastic. Every song in this film isn’t overused and matches perfectly with the age of the character. Somebody Miles age would be listening to the type of music he listens to. And the music without lyrics helps increase the emotion in the film. Also, there are two end credit scenes that are worth waiting for. In the end, this film is perfect for everybody. I give Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse a 10/10.', ""It's true I liked it less than perhaps the vast majority of _Spider-Verse's_ audience, but this was still great, the animation enamouring, and the depth of its story and reference totally engaging. Not to me the best Spider-Man movie as many have said, (that honour still goes to _Homecoming_) but a blast all the same.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:★★★½ - I really liked it. Would strongly recommend you give it your time._"", 'My wife doesn’t care for Spider-Man at all - as Batman is her favorite superhero.\r\n\r\nWith that being said, she loves this movie to death, along with my son and I. It’s safe to say we’ve watched this movie over 10 times and we’ve shown it to all our friends. It’s a really great movie that promotes diversity, good animation, and has a great story. I highly recommend to all who are interested in watching.', 'Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018) is no ordinary Spider-Man movie, it contains multiple characters with the same powers in multiple dimensions.\r\n This is also not an ordinary animated movie. It has animated style we have never seen before. There were 177 animators and it took 1 week to animate 1 second and 1 year to nail down 10 seconds. Nowadays, animations are being made to look real but this movie was different. However, the creators wanted it to look like something new for viewers. They don\'t make it realistic or cartoon. The creators used an old-school technique called ""smear"". If you look in a single frame, you\'ll notice things like multiple limbs to create the illusion of movement. Basically, the entire movie was a comic book that moves. There is a technique in half-toning, which uses dots to create colors and gradients. They were really jaw-dropping. The shadows were created with hatching or crisscrossed lines. The movie had some textures so it would be exactly like a comic and I was glad that it deserved Oscars\'s Best Animated Feature. All of these techniques combined to make a movie that was the best animated feature not just in 2018 but perhaps of all time. It was really like a masterpiece of animation!\r\n The story plot was really good. The scenes were quite EPIC and sometimes tragic and hilarious. The unbelievable thing was when Peter Parker died in Miles\' Dimension. It was really sad to see an iconic superhero killed by a supervillain. The deaths are moving and the hilarious scenes kept me laugh a lot. I like the end-credits when it started in the Animated Tv Show Spider-Man (1966) when the two Spider-Men look exactly like each other arguing, but this time, it was Spider-Man pointing to Spider-Man 2099. How did they do that? Perhaps the best moment to me was “A Leap of Faith” when Miles tried to be the one and only Spider-Man in his dimension, after Peter Parker was dead.\r\nI wasn\'t bored watching this movie, it kept my eyes open on the screen looking at the newest kind of animation.

Surprisingly, it didn't and I had my eyes glued to the screen because of the awesome animation the creators put out. Really good job!"", ""Spider-Man has always been that character that I saw in live-action movies so to see him in an animated version was a first for me. It was hard for me to enjoy it at first but the movie didn't seem too bad and had a really good plot."", 'At first,  I expected I was gonna be disappointed because all of the trailers for this Spider-Man looked childish and too millennial for me. And being a fan of the Tobey Spider-Man, I had high expectations. Surprisingly though, I was able to still love the film!', 'No doubt about it. This is truly Marvel, from the bold storytelling all the way to its stylish animations.', 'A lot of risks were taken in this video and all that paid off giving us one hell of a film!', 'Although the story was a textbook plot, it still had enough twists to satisfy both new and returning audiences.', ""This definitely has Stan Lee's seal of approval. People in the studio, be proud of yourselves. You have made Stan Lee proud."", 'One of the few films that lived up to the hype and even surpassed my expectations.', ""Watched this movie a couple of times and I think it's safe to say that it's a near, perfect movie."", 'Animators really outdid themselves on this one by giving each character a uniqueness to them.', 'Sony really nails making character movement look detailed and pronounced.', ""Despite having a plot that's almost predictable, the visual style and the way it was presented made the film feel fresh."", ""The visuals, concepts, soundtrack, and characters are some of the best I've ever seen!""]"

As a stand-alone film, however, The Two Towers is not quite as good as Fellowship. (Nor, indeed, does it extend the universe or deepen the relationships in the manner of The Empire Strikes Back.) That it still merits the full five stars is merely an indication of how high the benchmark has been set.\r\n\r\nPicking up pretty much where Fellowship left off, this is a considerably darker film, with Frodo (Wood) falling further under the influence of the Ring (giving rise to some seriously spooky hallucinations), while Saruman (Christopher Lee) wreaks even more havoc. There\'s also the first appearance of Saruman\'s spy, the sinister Wormtongue (Brad Dourif), and the complex Gollum, a brilliant combination of computer trickery and raspy vocals from Andy Serkis (the campaign for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar starts here).\r\n\r\nOther newcomers include Faramir (David Wenham), the understandably miffed brother of the recently deceased Boromir, and Éowyn (Miranda Otto), who spends much of her time casting winsome glances in the general direction of Aragorn (Mortensen). Eventually the plot complexities become more coherent, setting the action up for the forthcoming finale, The Return Of The King.\r\n\r\nAs we\'ve come to expect, this is spectacular stuff - from an opening which sees Frodo troubled by dreams about the demise of Gandalf, through to the climactic Battle Of Helm\'s Deep, which is nothing short of breathtaking. But Jackson cleverly tempers the louder, brasher sequences with some heartstring-tugging moments - peasants despondent as they are forced to abandon their villages, Aragorn and Arwen\'s troubled relationship, and, of course, the return of Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellen, superb as ever), one of the film\'s most powerful, memorable images that may well leave Ring devotees a little misty-eyed.\r\n\r\nHowever, those who still believe that the trilogy is beyond criticism may find their views challenged by The Two Towers. It\'s just as long as the first film, but gets the heroes no closer to a final victory. And, where the first movie developed its emotional tone from the brightness of The Shire to a darker climax, the sequel is more of a one-note affair, shadowy in both look and content.\r\n\r\nThis is particularly true of the Ringbearer\'s quest, which adds the not-insignifcant Gollum to the party, but suffers more than the other story strands from the cross-cutting and finishes with a nearly identical pep talk from Sam to the tearful speech that climaxed Fellowship. Of course, given the nature of the material, and Jackson\'s desire to be faithful, this is all understandable. And by the time we all end up under siege at Helm\'s Deep, it\'s unlikely anyone will give a toss about narrative arcs: like Gollum, this is simply gob-smacking, mind-blowing, never-seen-before stuff.\r\n\r\n\r\nVerdict - It may lack the first-view-thrill and natural dramatic shape of Fellowship, but this is both funnier and darker than the first film, and certainly more action-packed. An essential component of what is now destined to be among the best film franchises of all time. \r\n\r\n5/5\r\n\r\n- Caroline Westbrook, Empire Magazine', ""That Damned Ring.\r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 2002 and directed by Peter Jackson, “The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers” adapts the second part of JRR Tolkien’s popular fantasy trilogy about adventures on Middle-Earth. The surviving ‘Fellowship’ of the first film has been divided into three small groups for this one: The Hobbits Frodo and Sam (Elijah Wood and Sean Astin) team-up with the mad Gollum (Andy Serkis) to make their way to Mordor, but are captured by Faramir (David Wenham), the brother of the deceased Boromir. Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas the Elf (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli the Dwarf (John Rhys-Davies) encounter the once-great King Theoden (Bernard Hill), who has fallen under the spell of Saruman (Christopher Lee) via his devious minion Grima Wormtongue (Brad Dourif). Meanwhile the Hobbits Pippin and Merry (Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan) try to enlist the help of huge tree creatures. Gandalf is also on hand (Ian McKellen). These story threads culminate in the great Battle at Helms Deep in the third hour.  \r\n\r\nThis three-hour fantasy/adventure starts out more engaging than the first film, which was laden by its overlong, convoluted and (for the most part) unnecessary prologue. Like that movie, the characters are colorful, the tale is imaginative, there’s a lot of brutal action rounded out by quieter moments and everything LOOKS and SOUNDS great. Unfortunately, after the first act, Jackson opts for CGI porn (excessive use of CGI with the corresponding dizzying visual effects). The first film did this too, but this one ups the ante and so there’s not as much spectacular New Zealand cinematography (i.e. real forests, mountains, rivers, etc.). If cartoony CGI is your thang then you’ll likely appreciate this installment more than me.        \r\n\r\nThere are other problems: While the characters are imaginative, they’re also shallow and rather dull, at least for mature people who require more depth to maintain their interest. Also, the wide-spanning (meandering) story with numerous characters and hard-to-remember names tends to be disengaging. I was never much captivated by the characters and their causes, although uber-fans of Tolkien might be.  \r\n\r\nAnother problem is the lack of prominent female protagonists. We have Miranda Otto as Éowyn, Théoden's niece, who falls in love with the noble Aragorn and that’s about it, except for cameos by Liv Tyler as Arwen and Cate Blanchett as Galadriel. “Mythica: A Quest for Heroes” (2014) cost LESS THAN $100,000 to make, which is a mere fraction of the $94 million it cost to make this blockbuster and the filmmakers knew enough to include a couple of prominent babes as key protagonists in the story. \r\n\r\nDespite these negatives, “The Two Towers” was an ultra-ambitious undertaking and is a must for fantasy/adventure aficionados who liked the first movie.                      \r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours 59 minutes and was shot in New Zealand.  \r\n\r\nGRADE: B-/C+"", ""Still probably my favorite of the three, while it's pretty streamlined and far more action centric with little development compared with Fellowship of the Ring and Return of the King, I always find this one really entertaining with the Helm's Deep battle. **4.5/5**"", ""I might not have enjoyed it as much as the first film, but <em>'The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers'</em> is still a terrific film no doubt.\r\n\r\nVisually it still looks superb, I really do love the look of these films so far. The main plot is engaging and very interesting, while things like the costumes et al. remain at a high level. There is also top action, including some noteworthy battle sequences.\r\n\r\nThere are, though, a few bits I found less great - still very good in the grand overall scheme, but just comparably with the 2001 release. I found the pacing to be slightly off in moments, while a few of the new cast members didn't connect to me - e.g. Bernard Hill. The side story, meanwhile, with Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan didn't interest me at all... they spend too much of the run time just walking through a forest.\r\n\r\nElijah Wood remains good though. I did enjoy seeing the journey of Frodo and Sam (Sean Astin). Andy Serkis also gets more screen time with that aforementioned duo as Gollum, which is most definitely only a major positive - a fun character! Any scene with those three = outstanding.\r\n\r\nOverall, as noted, it is still an excellent film. One very much worthy of following <em>'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'</em>, despite a few 'issues' I have with it."", 'An awesome middle story of the trilogy.\r\nThe world of hobbits, elves, dwarves, and others finds a fellowship of nine beings separated to go on different paths. One is dead. Two are captured by orcs. One is presumed dead, but returns in a more powerful form. Three go to war. \r\nThe other two become the focus of this story. Hobbits Frodo and Samwise take a magic ring into the land of a devil and his beings, and find a guide, the pathetic Gollum, to aid them.\r\nMeanwhile, the three at war meet with the most interesting and multi dimensional character, King Theoden, and aid him against an onslaught of orcs and Uruk Hai. \r\nA lot of subplots go on, making this an unusually good connecting piece to the first and third films.', 'Having used the first film to magnificently, if - at times - a little too earnestly, set the scene and establish the characters, Peter Jackson now cleverly interweaves the continuation of the story as ""Frodo"" (Elijah Wood) and ""Sam"" (Sean Astin) take their evil talisman and make their way to the treacherous ""Mount Doom"" - alighting on the untrustworthy ""Gollum"" (a wonderful Andy Serkis) en route - to destroy it. Meantime ""Gandalf"", ""Aragorn""; ""Gimli"" and ""Legolas"" must track down ""Pip"" and ""Merry"" and stop ""Rohan"" from being over-run by the marauding hordes of ""Saruman"". This is certainly my favourite of any of the Wingnut Productions - the drama is compelling, exciting and the performances from all really draw you into the jeopardy of our questers. The imagination of the author is now in full swing as battle lines are firmly drawn - even the mud seems to be taking sides; the trees certainly do! The CGI is less effective in this film; particularly when used against the close up and the ""Treebeard"" scenes where it is oddly static and sterile, but the siege and battle scenes at ""Helm\'s Deep"", some poignant bonding moments between the elf and his dwarf companion and again the terrific accompaniment from Howard Shore make this, for my money, one of the best adventure films ever made. The director\'s cut - at a meagre 235 minutes - flew by on the big screen and sets it all up for a gripping finale in ""Return of the King"".']"

The film transcends the franchise, seamlessly combining elements of myth, science fiction, fantasy, war film, romance, bildungsroman, epic and tragedy in a way that its sequels have been unable to replicate. It is a move without a moment of fluff. Cut anything and the film would suffer. Story, character, effects, cinematography, music, screenplay, acting, editing and action are all superb. One of the most artistically poignant films ever made. And because its style cannot be replicated, it will continue to appreciate with age. \r\n\r\nThis was a time when George Lucas still had integrity, as evidenced in this 1980 Rolling Stone interview (he has since contradicted much of what he espouses in both word and deed): https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/the-empire-strikes-back-and-so-does-george-lucas-19800612\r\n\r\nHere's a blog article shows Empire's cinematic chiasmus, or narrative symmetry: https://dejareviewer.com/2014/05/20/cinematic-chiasmus-the-empire-strikes-back-is-a-perfectly-symmetrical-film/\r\n\r\nMy favorite version is the Team Negative1 Renegade Grindhouse Edition, an unrestored 35mm scan complete with damage and dust.

That it's not actually a sequel is irrelevant, it is of course the filler in a wonderful sci-fi sandwich, because as second instalments go, Empire has few peers. With Empire Strikes Back we get all the whizz bang adventure strewn heart of Star Wars, but George Lucas (stepping aside for Irvin Kershner to direct) has also fleshed the story out with a serious dark tone that oddly becomes a bedfellow to the romantic fun on offer, where new and engaging characters (and creatures) add spice to this wonderful fantastical broth.\r\n\r\nAided by the considerable writing talent of Leigh Brackett (The Long Goodbye, Rio Bravo, The Big Sleep), Lucas took the bold and ingenious step of giving the bad guys the upper hand, in fact it could be argued that he was taking a considerable risk with his ending. Forcing his viewers to wait for the final chapter (three years later), after tantalisingly setting us up with a corker of plot twist (one which is still to this day as potent as it was back on release), Lucas pulled perhaps one of the cheekiest carrot dangles in cinema history.\r\n\r\nThough more famed for its dark undertones, Empire is for sure still a very fun movie, C3PO goes into camp overdrive and Han Solo ups his quip quota by some margin. Then of course there is Yoda, in himself a comedic joy. The action sequences beg for repeat viewings, a battle on the ice laden planet Hoth is a marvel and the choreography for Skywalker's fight with Darth Vader is out of the top draw. But ultimately it's with the dark side that the picture excels. Complex and amazingly posing moral quandary's, The Empire Strikes Back is quite an experience, one that will forever hold up to repeat viewings for this particular viewer. 10/10"", '_**Fun, imaginative, iconic space adventure with a kick-axx cast**_\r\n\r\n""Star Wars V: The Empire Strikes Back"" (1980) was the anticipated follow-up to the initial mega-hit blockbuster from 1977. It’s an epic, but simplistic space fantasy about an evil empire and the noble souls who dare to fight it. The main cast features Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker), Harrison Ford (Han Solo), Carrie Fisher (Princess Leia), Billy Dee Williams (Lando Calrissian), Alec Guinness (Obi-Wan Kenobi) and the voice work of James Earl Jones (Darth Vader),  Frank Oz (Yoda) and Clive Revill (Emperor).\r\n\r\nThis is an amusing, inventive, iconic space adventure with a stellar cast. While I prefer the adult-oriented space science-fiction of Star Trek, I can’t deny that this space fantasy grants you an entertaining two hours with lots of sci-fi action, space ships, a snowy planet, asteroid caves and mysterious swamps. I also appreciate the mind-powers angle. It doesn’t hurt that Fisher is in her prime and easy on the eyes, not to mention Ford and Williams are at their charismatic best. Even the more obscure Hamill shines in his boyish youth. Then there’s RD-D2, C-3PO and Chewbacca.  \r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 7 minutes.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B', ""Terrific, again.\r\n\r\n<em>'The Empire Strikes Back'</em> follows up on the greatness of <em>'Star Wars'</em> with a highly enjoyable sequel. This one feels like a big moment in the franchise, at least to someone who doesn't know what's upcoming, as we get sizeable moments alongside some cool character reveals.\r\n\r\nMark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher continue to impress in their respective roles, as does James Earl Jones. Elsewhere, Billy Dee Williams and Frank Oz make for strong additions. There are, once again, fun roles for Anthony Daniels, Peter Mayhew and Kenny Baker.\r\n\r\nI'd say its predecessor has aged better - though that's not to say this film looks even the slightest bit bad, as it still looks fantastic throughout. The plot is as great as before, as is everything else really - namely the music, for one.\r\n\r\nI think I prefer the 1977 film over this, but there's barely anything separating the two in my thoughts to be honest. Both are awesome!"", 'So, I was almost 1 when this movie dropped and, well, it started the opening night tradition.\r\n\r\nOK, well, how to do this? I guess we will start with the hate. I like to address the hate in movies, especially ones that are well regarded and loved.\r\n\r\nNow, I\'ll excuse it for the people that just don\'t like Star Wars. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion.\r\n\r\nBut then there are the people that really hate Empire because of...reasons. And those reasons are Revenge of the Sith.\r\n\r\nI\'m sorry, panning Empire because of loyalty to the prequels--misplaced as it is--doesn\'t make I-III any better. It just makes you petty.\r\n\r\nNow, why its loved and, I\'ll admit, I am one of those fanboys that really do love this movie.\r\n\r\nFor starters, Empire went dark. It was the really the episode that the good guys lost and, that made it unique among, well, among just about every movie not made in the 1970s. I guess that is what made the 70s such a wonderful time for movies.\r\n\r\nWe could use a little more of that. We could use a lot more of that. We use a lot more gritty in cinema. And, we could use a lot more ""lived in"" Everything looks too clean.\r\n\r\nEmpire had that.\r\n\r\nAnd then it had that big, legendary, reveal that made all those kisses between Luke and Leia utterly wrong once the second big reveal hit in 1983...which explained that look Han gave Leia when she told him in the next installment.\r\n\r\nMoving on...\r\n\r\nWe have the Battle of Hoth, which, yeah, nerd awesomeness with kind of a WWI trench warfare v tanks feel and a WWII Evacuation of Dunkirk feel with the rebels on the run and the Empire forcing its way across the galaxy with brute strength.\r\n\r\nAnd that prolonged time on the Falcon, well, that was just brilliant for character development and, incest blocking.\r\n\r\nSo, really, honestly, there was way too much to love not to put Empire on the throne.', 'I have reviewed this film before but I thought that it deserved an extra special mention. Yesterday, this was the first film I saw in a cinema since we were all confined to barracks - and boy what a cracker. Where to start with the superlatives? It\'s fantastic - right from the opening bars of John Williams\' score; on through the three mini-adventures rolled into one, we are treated to a marvellous feast of well-written, snappily directed, entertaining action packed adventure. Picking up from the first film, our rebels are holed up on a frozen planet being relentlessly pursued by Darth Vader. When one of his probes discovers their icebound base, they\'ve got to get the hell out of there. Now sure, the CGI suffers a bit after 40 years; and can someone please tell me what the point of these lumbering Imperial Walkers is? They are like metal polar bears that constantly trip over their own shoelaces, but aside from those most minor of criticisms we have a great story; characters that we care about (personally, I\'m an huge Vader fan) and who develop plausible, credible personalities; the detailed animations of ""Yoda"" are superb to see again on the big screen and it builds excellently to a sword fight the like of which has not been seen since ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" (1938). It is, I think, better then the first film and for my money is the best sci-fi film ever made. Made for the big screen - and brilliantly made at that!']"

Not that you know this director very well, not at the international level. But with a film like this, she's going to be. This is another teen romance. Well, romance is not exactly a word that matches with what this film is about narrative, but there's no other way to describe its theme. It was like before romance, that mean before committing to a relationship and after you had started to like someone while fixing the mistakes made in the past.\r\n\r\nIt's a high school tale. Before that, it opened with a brief flashback of the elementary school events, where Shoya Ishida bullied a new admission Shoko Nishimiya for her hearing impairment. Soon after that, she'd transferred to another school. Now, a few years later, they meet again in the high school, where Ishida tried to fix what he had done wrong a while ago for her. So a relationship develops, despite people around them does not understand their commitment. At some point, it will be tested, which might lead to uncover their true feeling to one another.\r\n\r\nThis is surely aimed at the teen audience. Especially, the romance and sentimental parts are intended for the youngsters, but anyone would enjoy it. So, I felt them, but not like I'm still young. Otherwise, I would have said it is a masterpiece. That's only from the story perspective. The sketches and animations were not bad. The film characters were awesome. Each one was very unique and different people pick different characters as their favourite. I liked Yuzuru as I always like tomboyish type roles. But obviously Ishida and Shoko make this film.\r\n\r\n> ❝Please don't make such a serious face. And, let me say... I am sorry.❞\r\n\r\nSmooth animation. Technically comparable with any big names (anime titles). That also means the director is now in the league of the best anime-maker. She's young and I hope she keeps doing more films. As I said many times before, that after Hayao Miyazaki retired from making films, we need more people like this filmmaker to fill that empty space. The film won many awards for its great achievement, as well as box office success in the domestic market. Expecting the rest of the world and anime fans to receive it at the same extent.\r\n\r\nIt was originally based on the manga of the same name, and a television series was made before this feature anime. As I collect film quotes, the best ones, I was disappointed on that context. There were many emotionally and romantically appealing lines, but not on the moral perception. That does not mean the film lacks the social consciousness. In fact, the film highlights the bullying and its severe consequences. That alone is enough, this is a must see for the school kids.\r\n\r\nSurely kids, teens and some youngsters would love it, but as far as the adults, this is not an ideal thematic, yet you can't ignore its artistry and the intention of the film. Sometimes it might help you to like it in the second viewing. Because this is one of those kind. My issue was understanding the Japanese sign language. Besides, the subtitle for that was not much helpful, as it was exactly translated as what the hearing impaired character babbled which is an alternate spelling for every word and sentence.\r\n\r\nI had lots of fun watching it, as well as other moods like romantic, touching, annoyance, but overall it leans towards the good side. Just over two hours, it never looked too slow or hurried in the story or the character developments. Could be the best to pick as a date flick or get together with your school friends, particularly opposite sex friends. My final saying is, it is not to be missed for many reasons I've mentioned in this review and the other one is it being an anime, a quality one.\r\n\r\n_7/10_"", 'A Silent Voice: The Movie (2016) is an absolute gem! 🌟 This beautifully crafted anime film takes you on an emotional rollercoaster, touching your heart and leaving you with a sense of hope and understanding. The characters are so well-developed, and the animation is simply breathtaking. Prepare to be moved and inspired by this poignant story of redemption, forgiveness, and the power of empathy. Highly recommend it for anyone looking for a touching and meaningful cinematic experience!', '**A film that changed my vision of the life**\r\n\r\n""A Silent Voice"" is a film that has changed my vision of the life, understanding better the importance of the human communications. Including profound reflections related to empathy, self-esteem, redemption, self-improvement, and the importance of understanding and listening to others.\r\n\r\nThis film was truly made with love. Because it has a Sound-Track, thought and composed as if they were simulating the stimuli that a deaf person can feel throughout his life, such as the touch of someone or the vibrations of a cup of water.\r\n\r\nAlso, the way that it is made the animation and the camera angles, reflecting the feeling and the evolution of each character. Giving a unique impact because of the way it is well-thought-out.\r\n\r\nMaking me love this film even more for these details, feeling a unique and nostalgic experience when watching it, leaving it definitely one of the best films on a personal level. I don\'t understand how this film hasn\'t won any Oscar.']"

But that can be a tremendous blessing, especially when we’re confronted by circumstances where such aptitudes are called for. So it is for Roz (Lupita Nyong’o), a robot who inadvertently ends up stranded on a remote island when the vessel transporting her crashes without warning. Roz isn’t alone, though; she finds herself surrounded by a diverse array of forest animals who, curious though they might be, don’t quite know what to make of the mysterious metallic stranger. Meanwhile, the somewhat bewildered new arrival is out of her anticipated element, too, expecting to be in the company of humans for whom she’s been programmed to function as a domestic servant. However, the fundamental disconnect between these parties gradually dissipates as they each get to know one another, particularly when Roz needs to grow beyond her innate programming to overcome a series of challenges and bond with her new organic familiars, most notably a young goose (Kit Connor) whom she’s charged with raising when the gosling’s parents are accidently killed. Before long, Roz develops a sentience that helps her evolve beyond a collection of circuits and microchips, a development that proves valuable in a world beset by even bigger issues. In his latest animated feature outing, writer-director Chris Sanders has created a thoughtful, entertaining tale with an uplifting message we can all draw upon when life ups the ante on us. The picture’s stunningly gorgeous animation, solid writing, and delightfully amusing voiceover performances by the likes of Nyong’o and co-stars Pedro Pascal, Bill Nighy, Mark Hamill, Catherine O’Hara, Ving Rhames and Stephanie Hsu collectively deliver a fine mix of hearty laughs, inspiring insights and touching moments, all without becoming silly or saccharine. Admittedly, the film has a little trouble finding its footing at the outset, and a few story threads feel a little underdeveloped, such as subplots related to important but underexplained environmental themes. What’s more, it can be somewhat mystifying at times trying to figure out exactly who this offering was made for, as the material often comes across as a little more mature and decidedly more intense than what one might expect for younger viewers (despite its adorable depictions of its funny, furry forest creatures). However, these modest shortcomings are more than made up for the further one gets into the story, growing progressively stronger as the narrative unfolds. Most importantly, though, it’s gratifying to see a production that genuinely rises above the low bar that has been set for many releases in this genre these days. “The Wild Robot” is one of those films that’s sure to please a wide range of moviegoers, including those who generally aren’t particularly enamored with animation. It’s a feel-good movie that doesn’t resort to wearing that trait on its sleeve – but that nevertheless achieves such an admirably heartwarming effect anyways.', 'Brimming with thoughtful themes and stunning artwork, The Wild Robot is a deeply meaningful new touchstone in animated film.\r\n\r\nOf course, animation has “heroed” nature before – see The Lion King, WALL-E and basically the entire output of Studio Ghibli.

After spending a year learning their various languages, there follows a calamitous escapade with a nest, a chase with an hungry fox (""Fink"") and the creation of the most unlikely of family units charged with rearing a particularly timid little gosling whom they name ""Brightbill"". The scene is now set for some entertaining adventures as ""Roz"" has to teach her new-found charge how to eat, to swim and then ultimately to fly away so as to avoid the harsh winter. Each of those tasks comes with it\'s own hazards but maybe, just maybe, our little team can manage to get project ""Brightbill"" off the ground? No, of course there\'s no jeopardy here at all, and at times it\'s comes across as an amalgam of ""Wall:E"" (2008) with some Hans Christian Anderson thrown in for good measure. That\'s no bad thing, though, as the characterisation of the android is personable and develops amiably as his programming starts to evolve into something far more akin to a soul than a brain. It does tackle some more serious subjects - loneliness, rejection, isolation and issues with self-esteem to name a few, but always in fashion that illustrates a point then offers some sort of optimism that a solution can be found for even the most difficult challenges. The standard of animation is engagingly natural and it\'s genuinely quite funny with some of the observations, especially from the fox, working well within the framework of a touching story that extols the values of caring, teamwork and even a little forgiveness, without becoming gloopy or dialogue-heavy.

I was particularly impressed by the animation style, especially the distinct visual approach tailored to some characters. This creative choice truly makes them shine and adds depth to the storytelling.\r\n\r\nThat said, not every scene felt essential.

Decent script, great directing, selection of the repertoire and performances.\r\n\r\nJust sit down, get a good audio system and enjoy one of the best movies of the 2010s.', ""J K Simmons won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his mean, bullying monster. Jazz teacher Terence Fletcher who abhors the words 'good job.'\r\n\r\nFletcher tells a tale about Charlie Parker and how doing a good job was not enough for him. Good job means mediocrity.\r\n\r\nYet Fletcher is a mediocre educator and his college seems not to have noticed this. Instead of being an inspiration his students fear him. He is a nasty tyrant and an incident from his past comes back to haunt him.\r\n\r\nMiles Teller plays Andrew Neiman the put upon jazz drummer in the Shaffer Conservatory in New York. Neiman is eager to impress Fletcher but nothing he can do is good enough and withstands all the effluent Fletcher throws at him until one day he snaps.\r\n\r\nDamien Chazelle unleashed an unethical monster in Fletcher with Neiman providing the film's heart but I am not convinced that this is a good film. The rest of the students in the class are silent to the abuse taking place right in front of them. They are young adults, not kids and they do nothing about it."", ""When I sat down to watch this film, I didn't know what to expect. I am not usually a fan of films about musicians but this was a brilliant and tense masterpiece. The story is of a very ambitious boy named Andrew (played by Miles Teller) who is a music student in New York. He aspires to be noticed by a prestigious music teacher named Fletcher (played by J.K. Simmons). As his wish starts becoming a reality, he realises the brutality of this teacher who continually pushes him with questionable methods. Damien Chazelle's direction is almost of a tense boxing or war action drama in that it constantly uses the music of the drumming to build the tension whilst using violent and sharp editing whilst the jazz band play.\r\n\r\nChazelle's screenplay is very well written. It is filled with humour, tension and heartbreak. The way in which Fletcher switches during Andrew's first lesson is expertly done. Fletcher relentlessly insults Andrew in a very shocking way which really creates a huge sense of sympathy for Andrew's character as he struggles to respond. The insulting dialogue is very similar to Stanley Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket' in that it is both humourous and disturbingly distressing.\r\n\r\nThe performances in this film are remarkable. Miles Teller is a relative newcomer but takes to this character with so much depth and understanding. The drumming scenes look like incredible and torturous workouts and Teller really shows the pain and agony his character is going through to reach his dream. The chemistry between the two central characters is flawless. J.K. Simmons is perfect as the abusive music teacher. Simmons manages to combine Fletcher's distinguished persona with his terrifying unpredictability. Simmons reminds me of his character in Valve's 'Portal 2' in which he continuously spouts insults at the player in a darkly hilarious way.\r\n\r\nOverall, 'Whiplash' is a fascinating study of passion, ambition and love. The film asks questions about the morality of getting one's dreams and the acceptable methods of acquiring them. Full of amazing performances all around, and created with such intensity and spirit, my final rating for this film is 4.5 stars.\r\n\r\n★★★★½"", '""There are no two words in the English language more harmful than good job"".\r\n\r\nWhiplash follows are main character Andrew Neyman who is a young jazz drummer, single-minded in his pursuit to rise to the top of his elite east coast music conservatory. Plagued by the failed writing career of his father, Andrew hungers day and night to become one of the greats. Terence Fletcher, an instructor equally known for his teaching talents as for his terrifying methods, leads the top jazz ensemble in the school. Fletcher discovers Andrew and transfers the aspiring drummer into his band, forever changing the young man\'s life.\r\n\r\nOK let me just start off with this. You had no idea how much I was really looking forward to Whiplash. This was on my movies to check out list, because I heard nothing but positive things from this movie and I heard a lot of people described this film has the ""Full Metal Jacket"" but with no war or guns, but with music and well... drums. I think Whiplash and ""Birdman"" was the two movies I wanted to see before making my best movies of the year list, because who knows they might make the list. I haven\'t seen ""Birdman"" yet but will do soon, but I finally had the chance to see Whiplash and my god this movie was just so spectacularly flawless in many ways. Whiplash is the best move of 2014.\r\n\r\nJ.K. Simmons in this movie probably pulls of the best performance in his career. Every word that came out of his mouth didn\'t feel like he was reading from the script then act it out. I felt every angry punch of words that came out of him, because it was so real. I didn\'t see J.K. Simmons just playing a movie character in this movie, no he was the freaking Fletcher.\r\n\r\nNow let\'s talk about Terence Fletcher: The best way to describe Fletcher to those who haven\'t seen the film yet, well his like Sgt. Hartman from ""Full Metal Jacket"". When he\'s on screen your locked on and he\'s also the kind of person that would be somebody\'s worse nightmare to have for a boss. This guy doesn\'t just like music, he breaths music and he wants his band to do perfect. His opinion and his look on music is another thing why I didn\'t flat out just hated him, I actually understood him. He made a very good point about how people will comment on you act and say ""You did a good job"", and yes I did use the words ""you did a great job"", in my past reviews but now I\'m never going to use it ever again after this movie.\r\n\r\nMiles Teller was another stand out performances in this movie, and just like ""Foxcatacher"" where Channing Tatum was so over looked by his performance, well Miles Teller has proved himself to be more then a teen in a movie that will be forgotten and so would he, but no Miles Teller played this character so brilliantly he could become the next big thing. Now his character in this movie has the love of the true art of music and you can see that he wants to tell people his love for music, but when the harsh life of reality comes crashing into him it\'s truly heartbreaking to see his struggle and effort just not being good enough. Teller played this character so realistic and so brilliantly flawless.\r\n\r\nThe directing and the writing in this was just....perfect. Damien Chazelle gave this movie style and passion to tell a story about two strong music buffs battling out and he freaking nailed it.\r\n\r\nThis movie also had probably the best finale that I\'ve seen in years. My nails were digging into the seat. I didn\'t dare to look away not for one moment, not for one second. I was simply locked on and when it was over... I\'m kidding you I actually clapped towards the end of this movie. Now the biggest cliche that I always hear from critics when their talk about a different movies and their use words like ""You will clap at the end"", but you don\'t, or ""You will feel inspired after the film"", and I you don\'t. But Whiplash actually did make me feel inspirited towards the end and made me clap. It\'s message of not giving up and the dream that you been chancing for isn\'t just going to come to you. Movies like Pride, freedom Writers and all that such never ever give me that inspiring feeling inside of me, until I watched this movie.\r\n\r\nOverall rating: Whiplash is a movie that everybody needs to see. This isn\'t just a popcorn movie where you come and put you legs up and laugh a couple of times, no this movie reaches out to people out there that have the same problems that these character\'s have, with their passion of what their what to do in life get\'s over shadowed by something you don\'t want to do and this movie get\'s it right. So go and see if you have the chance.', '**Whiplash grips its audience from start to finish with a remarkable awe-inspiring performance by J. K. Simmons.**\r\n\r\nBRUTAL! Whiplash is a savage film with mind-blowing career-defining performances, interesting storytelling, and palpable oppressive anxiety. J. K. Simmons didn’t deserve an Oscar for this movie… he deserved all the Oscars. I was in awe of the intensity and cruelty Simmons unleashed throughout the film while peppering in moments of vulnerability that keep the audience guessing if he is a clever mentor or a manipulative abuser. I love how the film ends, leaving that very question open-ended. I didn’t enjoy the volume of language, and obviously, the subject matter of the movie wasn’t a fun focus, but the mastery of the performances, cinematography, and storytelling establish Whiplash as a true Oscar-worthy film.', ""It is less than what is described as a wonderful piece of art consisting of music, artistic performance, directing and photography. It's one of my favorite movies. This piece of art inspired me"", ""Pretty intense drumming movie. I think it's about the pursuit of perfection and maybe something about fathers. Really great finale. Fingers bleeding. Put this ham on your face!"", 'The critics bestowed upon this film almost unanimous praise, yet some were quick to bemoan it as “overrated”. It’s the same old story. And while sometimes the “bemoaners” may be right, this time it is just proof that they are mostly wrong.\r\n\r\nWhiplash is utterly fantastic, entertaining and yet somehow brutal and harrowing at the same time. We watch in fascinated horror as Miles Teller’s character ascends, descends and ascends again into one fleeting last moment of glory.\r\n\r\nWhile the film’s editing and sound-design is top-notch, the performances of J.K. Simmons and Miles Teller keep this afloat.\r\n\r\nA masterpiece, do absolutely watch.']"

It stars Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey and R. Lee Ermey. Music is scored by Howard Shore and cinematography by Darius Khondji.\r\n\r\nAn unnamed US city and two cops are on the trail of a serial killer who kills his victims according to which one of the seven deadly sins they have committed.\r\n\r\nHaving been stung by the studio interference and negative fall out regarding his directorial debut feature film, Alien 3, David Fincher waited three years before committing to a project that he had control over. The result was Seven, a dark masterpiece of unremitting creeping dread that showcased the work of a clinically excellent director. Seven is not just a movie, it\'s an experience, an assault on the senses, a jolt to the brain, a trawl through the dark recess of some sick city where it always rains and the darkness holds many fears. This is no boorish slasher movie, it\'s psychological discord 101, we only see the aftermath of crimes, the discussions of which forces us to delve deep into our own imagination to fill in the blanks, forcing us to go where we don\'t want to go, you sense the director is somewhere gleefully pulling our strings.\r\n\r\n""But that\'s the point. We see a deadly sin on every street corner, in every home, and we tolerate it. We tolerate it because it\'s common, it\'s trivial. We tolerate it morning, noon, and night. Well, not anymore. I\'m setting the example. What I\'ve done is going to be puzzled over and studied and followed... forever""\r\n\r\nSeven is very much an ultimate horror film, really is there anything more scary than a serial killer who is smarter than the cops chasing him? Not only that but they are, oblivious as they be, part of the master plan. This killer is not only unstoppable in perpetrating his violent crimes, he is, as Freeman\'s weary retirement bound Detective Somerset says, methodical and patient. It\'s going to end bad, the cops know it and so do we, and that\'s when Fincher and Walker stick their hands into our guts and pull out the last semblance of solids to deliver one of the greatest endings of modern cinema. An ending fit to grace any noir, neo-noir or smart ass psychological horror movie from across the ages. With each viewing of Seven there\'s the repeating wave of bleak emotions that come as the reversed end credits roll, desolation and disbelief, sadness and shock, our trip through earthly hell is over, but only in the psychical sense!\r\n\r\nFaultless cast performances, no doubt eked out by what we now know is a task-master director, photography that brilliantly brings to ""light"" the melancholic sheen of a decaying society and a Howard Shore score that crawls out of the speakers and cloaks your body like some evil Incubus or Succubus. Seven, a masterpiece of unease and evil wrung out by a master director. 10/10', 'Se7en put David Fincher on the map with this uber-creepy mystery thriller. The crime scenes are so grisly Seven is often ranked with top horror movies. And the ending -- hoo boy. One of the best twists in modern movie history.', 'If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog @\r\nhttps://www.msbreviews.com\r\n\r\nI\'ve never written or even thought about my favorite movies of all-time. I don\'t believe in having a definite Top10 or Top20 of every film I\'ve ever seen. However, if I had to write this special list, I have no doubts that Se7en would be there. Obviously, this is a rewatch of the classic movie that impacted filmmaking and launched David Fincher\'s remarkable career (I also ignore the fact that Alien 3 is connected to Fincher due to the known production issues). With his next film, Mank, coming up on Netflix in a few weeks, I decided to go through part of his filmography. Se7en will be the first out of five Fincher\'s movies that I will be able to revisit throughout this week.\r\n\r\nI\'ve seen this film countless times, but to be completely honest, I haven\'t seen it in so long that I didn\'t remember exactly some important plot points and a key component about the ending. This helped me experience Se7en in a fascinating way once again. Andrew Kevin Walker\'s screenplay has one of the most intriguing, mysterious, captivating narratives I\'ve ever witnessed, still to this day. From the very beginning to the last second, I\'m constantly at the edge of my seat (in this case, my couch) with severe anxiety levels and feeling incredibly tense. Biting my nails, moving my leg up and down, changing positions… it\'s so mesmerizing that I\'m only writing about it more than twenty-four hours after I watched it.\r\n\r\nOne of the most impressive aspects is how Fincher is able to leave the viewer uncomfortable with showing only a single death on-screen. This is an extremely dark, gory, blood-soaked, gruesome flick, packed with horrible displays of dead bodies, but never the actual murder scene. With just a simple photo or a straight line of dialogue, Fincher lets the viewer\'s imagination do the work, and it\'s undoubtedly as or more effective than a visually horrific killing sequence. As the premise implies, the serial killer is inspired by the ""seven deadly sins"", and he goes after the respective sinners, killing them (or letting them kill themselves) in an innovative fashion, turning the sin against the sinner.\r\n\r\nThe gluttony and sloth cases are visually brutal, but the lust murder is the one that keeps haunting my memory. The latter is also the less explicit, left to open-minded people to imagine the despicable act. In 1995, a movie with such a dismal environment and dark story couldn\'t be well-received, and Se7en got its fair share of negative reviews stating that it was too obscure, sinister, overly violent and that the ending was absolutely unacceptable. Over time, it found its success, it gained fans all around the world, and it\'s now considered by many as one of the greatest films ever made, myself included. From the outstanding cast to the astonishingly enthralling detective work, the third act stands out as one of the most shocking endings of all-time.\r\n\r\nI\'m keeping this review spoiler-free because I don\'t want readers who have not seen this movie to have such a magnificent piece of cinema ruined for them. That\'s why I\'m also hiding a certain actor from the starring section, just like the marketing team did at the original date of release (I\'ll get there). Fincher\'s third act is simply flawless. Everything displayed on-screen in the last twenty minutes is filmmaking perfection. From the impressively suspenseful build-up to that jaw-dropping climactic moment, passing through a mind-blowing revelation, Se7en\'s conclusion is and will remain as one of the most brutally shocking endings in the history of cinema.\r\n\r\nMorgan Freeman and Brad Pitt share fantastic chemistry, portraying two iconic characters that couldn\'t be more different than one another. Somerset is a notable detective with extreme attention to detail, knowledgeable, and always curious about the case at hand. Freeman incorporates this character effortlessly, delivering a subtle yet powerful performance. Pitt portrays Mills, a childish, unfocused, immature replacement to the previous detective about to retire. Despite its apparent lack of work ethics, Mills is clever, relentless in finding the killer, and desperately wants to prove himself. Pitt, just like Freeman, embodies this persona seamlessly and also gives an outstanding interpretation.\r\n\r\nTechnically, where should I begin? From the haunting score of Howard Shore to the documentary-like cinematography (Darius Khondji) that offers a tremendously realistic atmosphere, it\'s the phenomenal production design that stands out. Fincher really wanted the dirty, rainy, depressing city to feel authentic and as real as possible. The first dialogues of the film are meant to point out the bleakness and awfulness of the city, but even without these conversations, any viewer will be able to acknowledge the absence of color, joyfulness, and life in this unknown location. Fincher\'s filmmaking techniques are demonstrated in plain splendor for everyone to see, and this was just his beginning.\r\n\r\nMovies like Se7en are impossible to be made today, period. It would never be conceivable to completely hide one of the main actors from the press tour and/or trailers. We live in a time where the promotion of a film must have everything and everyone. Nowadays, trailers show way too much, and this isn\'t news to anyone. The ending was forced by Pitt and Fincher since the studio wanted a more mainstream conclusion. Today, filmmakers may have more freedom, but there are still countless cases of executive producers changing a movie without the director\'s will and/or permission. Se7en was a film released in a time where it should have never been released in the first place. Fortunately, it was.\r\n\r\nSe7en might be the best director\'s sophomore movie in the history of cinema, and it\'s undoubtedly one of my favorite films of all-time. David Fincher\'s classic possesses one of the most captivating screenplays I\'ve ever witnessed, marked by an extremely dark, somber, violent, gruesome story that ends with one of the most emotionally shocking conclusions to a movie, ever. The lack of on-screen death scenes is both the most surprising and effectively powerful element of the whole film, leaving the unpleasant work of imagining a specific type of murder to the viewer\'s mind. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are extraordinary as the now iconic detectives, delivering two truly brilliant performances. Fincher\'s trademark filmmaking style started here, as every technical aspect contributes to the movie\'s incredible realism. From the simple, documentary-like camera work to the ominous score, it\'s the authentic production design that sets the depressing tone, the bleak atmosphere, and the rainy, colorless, lifeless city. Overall, it\'s a technically flawless piece of art. One of the greatest films ever made…. I can\'t recommend it more.\r\n\r\nRating: A+', 'Some creative kills and a decent atmosphere fail to obscure a vapid nihilism, rather meandering plot with a twist that makes little sense, and some quite nasty misogyny. Basically two or three admittedly masterful performances away from being nothing more than a padded ultra-violent bad Law and Order episode. The Brakhage-inspired title sequence is orders of magnitude better than the film itself. The hodgepodge of contextless references to classic literature doesn\'t make this any cleverer, either. This is basically everything that people who don\'t watch ""film bro movies"" unfairly think all modern thrillers are like. Has aged horribly as well.', 'Morgan Freeman is the veteran detective ""Somerset"" who is saddled with the newly married rookie ""Mills"" (Brad Pitt) and sent to investigate quite possibly the most ghastly murder scene cinema has ever produced. A man has been force-fed beans until he, quite literally, burst! A missing slither of kitchen floor lino suggests the fridge had recently been moved and behind that they find a clue - one that suggests this man had committed one of the deadly sins (gluttony) and therefore it\'s reasonable to assume that six more, equally heinous, killings may follow. Indeed when they start to doc just that, both detectives must hastily learn to work together - despite their contrasting approaches to police work - if they are to piece together the evidence. What makes matters worse for the pair, is that they begin to suspect that they are the metaphorical ball of wool for the killer\'s cat. They get closer and closer, but are always just that little bit late as this self-appointed weapon of god seems to be being wielded with every more horrific killing. David Fincher allows both actors here to develop this mystery compellingly, with a sparing but potent dialogue and an almost perfectly paced and scored progress as we all know what must come last - but never will we anticipate just how the coup de gras will be delivered. This is one of these superior crime dramas that leaves a little more to think about each time I watch it. Really good.']"

Not only must this teacher galvanise his hitherto indifferent students, but he has to win over his sceptical boss else he\'s going to end up out of a job! What now ensues is based on a true story and I think could be doing with being shown in classrooms everywhere. Not just because it clearly demonstrates the sheer power an inspirational teacher has to enable young minds, but also to remind kids in better off communities that education (with our without technology) is a thing to be valued. This man offers them a template to teach themselves; to solve problems and develop teamwork skills and to realise that their options are not quite as limited as might have seemed when they started compulsory schooling with precious little interest in any of it. It also asks questions about the rigid nature of repetitive learning and invites us to consider what is or isn\'t a teacher\'s place in a community that is historically constrained by perceptions of realism. Can any of these youngsters really aim high and deliver, or is it all pipe dreams? There\'s a fun dynamic between Derbez and Haddad and the storyline allows us to observe some of the more salient issues that affect these people growing up - poverty, drugs, corruption and family all playing their own decisive part in influencing how education fits into their society.

He dares to challenge conventional teaching methods, offering an alternative approach rooted in curiosity, dialogue, and active participation. As Sergio navigates numerous obstacles, he surpasses his own expectations, though not without facing tragic consequences. This film critiques the current education system, which often produces individuals who function like machines rather than critical thinkers.

Well if you really break this movie at it\'s core, it\'s about two grieving men (Leo and Murphy), both haunted by the past until they have the strength to accept reality and let them go.\r\n\r\nThe \'Grow Old Together\' scene stuck with me the most.\r\n\r\nYou can say whatever you want about Christopher Nolan, but his movies are never hollow. I\'m also convince that Nolan would be the perfect choice to direct a James Bond movie.\r\n\r\nSeriously, throughout the whole movie I was thinking ""Man imagine the genius behind Inception directing a Bond movie"". The ingredients are right there.', 'This is actually a Perfect movie. It is the 2nd perfect movie I\'ve seen and it is flawless in almost every way. Since perfection itself is an imaginary value like Infinity or <a href=""https://paperhelp.nyc/"">paperhelp</a> that when you add +1 to it, or make it better in any way, that adds to the imaginary state of infinity itself making it factually an imaginary number. There are only a few issues, such as a little too fast pacing, even though the film itself is about 2:17:00 long, and also I would have preferred them not show the helper on the train until After it was revealed to be a 2nd dream state. Also some bland emotional displays overall. Other than these small issues it is as perfect as a movie can be made. Totally Amazing film when you are in the mood for an action movie. WATCH TWICE, or more, as it would be nearly impossible to truly experience this film without seeing it 2 times in short breaks between viewings.', 'Crazy movie. I gotta watch a few more times I was confused. It would be sweet to build your own simulations though.', 'Christopher Nolan\'s ""Inception"" is a masterful blend of science fiction and psychological thriller, exploring the depths of the human subconscious. Leonardo DiCaprio delivers a compelling performance as Dom Cobb, a skilled thief who infiltrates dreams to steal secrets. The film\'s intricate plot, stunning visuals, and Hans Zimmer\'s powerful score create an immersive experience that challenges the boundaries of reality. Each layer of the dream world is meticulously crafted, leading to a mind-bending climax that leaves viewers questioning the nature of their own reality. ""Inception"" is a must-watch for those who appreciate complex storytelling and innovative cinema.', '<article>\r\n  <h1>Inception: A Mind-Bending Masterpiece of Modern Cinema</h1>\r\n\r\n  <h2>Christopher Nolan\'s Visionary Dreamscape</h2>\r\n  <p>Christopher Nolan\'s ""Inception"" (2010) stands as a testament to the power of original storytelling in modern cinema. This science fiction thriller takes viewers on a mesmerizing journey through the intricate landscapes of the human mind, exploring the nature of reality, dreams, and the subconscious. With its multi-layered narrative and stunning visual effects, ""Inception"" challenges audiences to question the very fabric of their perception, solidifying Nolan\'s reputation as one of the most innovative filmmakers of our time.</p>\r\n\r\n  <h2>Plot and Concept: Dreams Within Dreams</h2>\r\n  <p>At its core, ""Inception"" follows Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), a skilled extractor who can infiltrate people\'s dreams to steal information. Cobb is offered a chance at redemption and a way back to his children through one last job: planting an idea in someone\'s mind, a process known as inception. This seemingly impossible task involves creating a dream within a dream within a dream, pushing the boundaries of what\'s possible in both the dream world and filmmaking itself. The intricate plot weaves together elements of heist movies, psychological thrillers, and mind-bending science fiction, creating a narrative tapestry that is as complex as it is captivating.</p>\r\n\r\n  <h2>Performances and Characters: A Dream Team</h2>\r\n  <p>DiCaprio delivers a powerful performance as the tormented Cobb, haunted by the memory of his wife Mal (Marion Cotillard). The supporting cast, including Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, and Cillian Murphy, bring depth and nuance to their roles, each contributing significantly to the film\'s emotional core and intricate plot mechanics. Cotillard\'s portrayal of Mal is particularly noteworthy, embodying both allure and danger as a projection of Cobb\'s guilt-ridden subconscious. The ensemble cast\'s chemistry and individual performances elevate the film, grounding its high-concept premise in genuine human emotion and conflict.</p>\r\n\r\n  <h2>Visual Spectacle and Technical Mastery</h2>\r\n  <p>Nolan\'s vision is brought to life through stunning cinematography by Wally Pfister and groundbreaking visual effects. The film\'s most iconic scenes, such as the folding Paris cityscape and the zero-gravity hotel fight, are not merely eye candy but integral parts of the narrative. These visually arresting moments serve to illustrate the malleable nature of the dream world while pushing the boundaries of what\'s possible in cinema. Hans Zimmer\'s score complements the visuals perfectly, adding layers of tension and emotion to every scene. The technical prowess displayed in ""Inception"" sets a new standard for blockbuster filmmaking, seamlessly blending practical effects with CGI to create a world that feels both fantastical and tangible.</p>\r\n\r\n  <h2>Legacy and Impact: A Dream That Lingers</h2>\r\n  <p>Since its release, ""Inception"" has sparked countless discussions and debates, particularly regarding its ambiguous ending. This open-ended conclusion invites viewers to question the nature of reality and the power of perception, leaving a lasting impact long after the credits roll. The film\'s influence can be seen in subsequent movies that explore similar themes of reality versus illusion. ""Inception"" not only entertains but also challenges its audience, encouraging multiple viewings to fully grasp its complexity. It stands as a pinnacle of Nolan\'s filmography, showcasing his ability to blend high-concept ideas with emotional depth and spectacular action. In the landscape of modern cinema, ""Inception"" remains a towering achievement, a dream from which many viewers may never want to wake.</p>\r\n</article>']"

There are plenty of special moments and guest appearances that follow from the more obscure to the mainstream and the range of emotions from the audience at the press screening as they reacted to the film showed they were deeply engaged and loving it.\r\n\r\nThe film does take a darker turn and does end in a cliffhanger which sets up the next film very well but also may be a bit darker than younger viewers might want. That being said; I enjoyed this film far more than I did the prior film. I found the animation style a bit off-putting as the jerky way the characters moved was a bit much over the length of a feature film. This time around there is a mix of animation styles throughout and at times in the same frame which may be a bit hard for some as the film does come at the viewer with waves of flashing lights, sounds, and animations that very cleverly mimic reading a comic complete with small boxes to define various characters from time to time.\r\n\r\nThe film runs nearly two and a half hours and did seem to go on a bit long at times but thanks to the great voice-acting and strong cast as well as engaging storyline I found myself eagerly looking forward to the next film.\r\n\r\nI first saw a rough cut of a scene at Cinemacon in 2022 and it was amazing seeing the final scene near the opening of the film as it was a rare instance of a film surpassing expectations and delivers the storyline and action with a good dose of solid characters that fans will love.\r\n\r\n4.5 stars out of 5', 'Sad night tonight. After 80-odd years, this was the last film to show in my local cinema before it closed down. Doubly sad because it’s also not actually very good. The conceptualisation behind the hybrid styles of animation is spectacular and executed in an highly polished fashion - as you’d expect. The story is all over the pace though, and the proliferation of Spidey’s seemed designed more to allow the narrative to become more culturally inclusive (and bankable) rather than to develop any meaningful characterisations. What personas there are spend their time wallowing in a mire of unrequited and/or confused familial love, or teenage angst more suitable in a soap. The dialogue has it’s moments - assuming you can catch it - and there’s a bit of humour to be found but I found the audio mix made following all that was said became a bit wearisome after a first hour that really does depend on your having watched (and remembering) the first - in my view far better - instalment. This whole “multiverse” theme can keep on recycling itself ad nauseam but if the writing remains at this unremarkable level then I’m not sure I’ll be bothering with the next set of repetitively set-piece adventures for “Miles” and his parents, love interest and fellow Spider-folk.', 'FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://www.firstshowing.net/2023/review-spider-man-across-the-spider-verse-is-an-animated-work-of-art/\r\n\r\n""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is the epitome of incredibly detailed, gorgeously unique, undeniably epic animation within its medium. Separately from enjoying this movie or not, any or all cinephiles should bow to the ridiculously talented artists and animators behind this pure work of art.\r\n\r\nThat said, the attributes and issues are more or less the same as the original. The various animation styles are overwhelmingly stunning, but also to the point of creating confusing moments. Gwen Stacy stands out from the rest of the pack – both the character and Hailee Steinfeld\'s voice performance – but everyone on screen is impressively captivating. The voice cast is superb all-around.\r\n\r\nAn unfinished story – remember, this is the first of two parts – about what it really means to be a hero. The 140-minute runtime isn\'t exactly heavy, but the necessity to resort to exposition scenes is more frequent than in the previous flick, even though the narrative complexity ends up justifying this.\r\n\r\nA must-see movie in the cinema! Go support animation.""\r\n\r\n\r\nRating: A-', 'And perhaps _Beyond the Spider-Verse_ will retroactively make Across’ story more enjoyable, but for now, the franchise’s flashy visuals are fully in controls of its web-shooters.\r\n\r\nAs a stand alone feature, _Across the Spider-Verse_ is groundbreaking with its half-a-dozen animation styles and plethora of Spider-Men. The Spot is an insanely cool villain, Spider-Man 2099 is an anti-hero teetering on the verge of becoming a full-time villain, and Spider-Punk oozes overall awesomeness.\r\n\r\nBut with the film sitting at 162 minutes and a sequel on the way in less than a year, the story ultimately feels like it’s stretched beyond its means.\r\n\r\n**Full review:** https://boundingintocomics.com/2023/06/07/spider-man-across-the-spider-verse-review-a-stunning-labyrinthine-benchmark-for-animation/', 'I don\'t know, but in my humble opinion, the punk Spider-Man really needed to look like Johnny Rotten, Sid Vicious, someone from the Sex Pistols.  He sort of screamed them in the way he was depicted, right down to the multi-media used around him.\r\n\r\nThey really missed an opportunity for if not a great pop culture reference, but at least an in-joke for the punk community.  I mean, throw us a bone here.  He spent half his time mocking us anyway (in a pretty hysterical way) at least give us the laugh when they do the face reveal.\r\n\r\nAnyway, it\'s not bad.  Miles is less... boring in this cartoon than he is in the comics where he\'s developed the moniker ""Mild Morales.""  He actually has more depth of character here and is forced to face some serious choices and turning points (Hey Marvel, you could learn a lesson here).  \r\n\r\nBut he also took a bit of a back seat to Stacey, who seemed to be the star of the show until there was an abrupt switch... which irritated me.  It sort of screamed ensemble cast, but really it just shifter from one lead to the other a bit abruptly.  As far as complaints go, that\'s pretty bare bones.\r\n\r\nIt also gave Spidey 2099 a sort of bad spin despite being the most beloved of the 2099 line and the coolest costume design of any spider.  So for us Gen-Xers, it sort of burned.  At least I\'m old enough to have been looking forward to his inclusion only to be a little disappointed. \r\n\r\nAnd I am still very upset over how Peter is portrayed, but they are slowly redeeming his character.\r\n\r\nOver-all though, it\'s not bad.  It\'s better than just about all of the current Super-Hero movies and, honestly, it\'s probably the only cape franchise that people are still interested in... because it isn\'t totally political BS.', 'Rating: 9.5\r\n\r\nOverall, another groundbreaking film in the franchise that only builds on everything they created in the previous film as the brilliant animation and incredible writing is used to show the audience a well-rounded story about a Spider-Man who is trying to find his place in the world, with the only major drawback of the movie being that it suffers from the flaws of it being one of two parts.', 'I don’t have that much to say about “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse”, the sequel to the equally terrific 2018 Oscar winning film “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,” except that it’s easily one of the best films of the year. It’s the type of achievement in animation that’s not only artistically skilled but also wildly entertaining. This is one of the most perfect pieces of animated cinema in years and even better, it’s aimed squarely at more sophisticated audiences of older kids, teens, and adults.\r\n\r\nMiles Morales (voice of Shameik Moore) is back for part two, and he’s happily fulfilling his duties as Brooklyn’s friendly neighborhood superhero. Miles finds himself joining forces with Gwen Stacy (voice of Hailee Steinfeld) and a new team of elite Spider heroes (featuring the voices of Jake Johnson, Karan Soni, Issa Rae, and others) from across the multiverse as they work together to fight off a powerful villain.\r\n\r\nThe plot is complex, but the story is terrific. The parallel universes at play don’t feel like a gimmick, and there are real stakes for every character. There are strong messages about teamwork, friendship, power, and responsibility, and it’s nice to see more female representation in a film that prides itself on diversity and inclusion. The story is a little slow at the start, but things pick up ones Miles enters the picture. His relationship with Gwen is developed extensively here, and they’re a great onscreen duo.\r\n\r\nThe film is computer-animated, and the visuals are nothing short of masterful. The animation is vibrant, skillfully executed, and absolutely stunning. This is the type of visual art that leaves your eyes begging for more. From the attention to detail to the choice of hues, there isn’t one misstep to be found.\r\n\r\nThe story, however, has a few stumbles, and most of that stems from the overly long run time (2 hours, 20 minutes), the too-insider Easter egg references for diehard comic fans, and the irritating cliffhanger ending that is so obnoxious that it almost ruins everything that came before. Thank goodness the rest of the movie is so much fun.\r\n\r\n“Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” is the type of film that proves animation isn’t just for kids, and it’s certainly not a throwaway medium that deserves to be dismissed. It’s an action-packed, visually dazzling, frentic, and outrageously fun piece of cinema. Go see it.\r\n\r\nBy: Louisa Moore', 'Incredible non stop action movie', '“It’s like if The Raid met Into The Spiderverse”']"

Jeffries (Jimmy Stewart), an adventurous photographer, is temporarily immobilized by a serious leg injury.  Bored, and living in a time where TV and internet were not available as distractions, he watches the courtyard out his real window and speculates about the lives of the neighbors that he sees.  In particular, he wonders whether his neighbor Thorvald (Raymond Burr, who actually looks older than his later character Perry Mason) may have killed his wife.\r\n\r\nHitchcock examines the situation from numerous points of view.  At one extreme, Jeff could be considered a brilliant detective who sleuths out a case based purely on close observation.  At the other end, he could be considered a voyeur and a paranoid whose suspicions could damage other people.  These interpretations are voiced by his acquaintances, including his nurse (Thelma Ritter) and his fiance  (Grace Kelly, the future Princess Grace of Monaco).  In the end physical evidence is found that settles the Thorvald case but leaves Jeff\'s motivation still in question.\r\n\r\nHitchcock takes advantage of the situation to introduce numerous subplots -- but they\'re MINIMALIST subplots, where the audience only sees what Jeff sees from his window.  (Mild spoilers follow)  Newlyweds quarrel, a depressed woman considers suicide but is rescued by a neighbor; a sexy girl (""Miss Torso"") turns out to be not a party girl but devoted to an absent boyfriend. \r\n\r\nAn entertaining thing about this movie is that we have numerous actors -- Stewart, Kelly, and Burr -- who are to become more famous for later movies and incidents.', ""It Had To Be Murder. \r\n\r\nL.B. Jefferies is a wheelchair bound photographer who by way of relieving his boredom, starts observing the lives of all his neighbours from his apartment window. As he gets deeper into the lives of all around him, he becomes convinced that one of hem has committed the act of murder, thus putting himself and those close to him in mortal danger.\r\n\r\nMuch like most of Alfred Hitchcock's other lauded pictures, Rear Window has been dissected, examined, appraised and written about by far more versed people than myself, a mere film fanatic. So how do I even start to write a review of a film that I view as one of Hitchcock's best? Well maybe I should just write what I like about it without delving into psycho babble and a deconstruction of the human psyche and all its little offshoots! So I will!.\r\n\r\nRear Window is adapted by Alfred Hitchcock and his writer John Michael Hayes, from the Cornell Woolrich story called It Had To Be Murder/Murder From A Fixed Viewpoint. The film of course forces us the viewers to become voyeurs, watching a newly hooked voyeur go about his business. Quite a neat trick from Hitchcock, and one can reasonably assume that the maestro director was chuckling with glee within his genius girth.\r\n\r\nWorking from the confines of a single set, Hitchcock has molded a suspenseful, intriguing, cheeky and sexy picture, with a top line cast giving the smart screenplay the performances it deserved. What is often forgot by those more concerned with the psychological aspects of Rear Window is the blatant irony of L.B. Jefferies situation, his obsession with the neighbours is not confined to a probable case of murder, his interest first and foremost is with the love lives of those he observes, thus forcing (excusing) him to acknowledge the love from the woman who so wants to be in his life!\r\n\r\nIt's also important to note the merits of each character of the piece, those that visit Jefferies and the conversations that take place, even the suspected murderer has a bemused interest pouring from his very frame. Rarely has a film been produced that has every single character having a critical element to the story. Then there is the ending where Hitchcock and his team weave all strands together to leave us wryly smiling away whilst simultaneously feeling that we have been had by the big director, and be under no illusions here, we have been at the mercy of a genius and party to a film of unquestionable quality. 10/10"", 'Probably have seen this a half dozen times over the years and still is my favorite Hitchcock movie, favorite mind you not best.

Gradually, he becomes suspicious of one of them as the wife suddenly disappears and the husband (Raymond Burr) starts making odd trips out at night; calling long distance and generally acting oddly. Grace Kelly (his girlfriend) thinks this all a bit too prurient for her but is slowly drawn into his web of intrigue and ends up an active participant with his investigations as we now have a great conspiracy theory thriller. Thelma Ritter is great as ""Stella"" as is Wendell Corey as ""Det. Doyle"".

So, for me, _The Silence of the Lambs_ is a childhood favorite. Some would say I had an unusual childhood, in this age where some people actually **avoid** R-rated movies like the plague. The fact that I saw _Something Wild_, which Jonathan Demme directed five years before _The Silence of the Lambs_, as well as the original _Alien_ (alone at that), at the same age probably indicates that they were okay with me watching pretty much anything that wasn\'t rated X, though, honestly, I\'ve **never** had any interest in that stuff. It was probably due to the fact that, like the movie\'s protagonist, I don\'t ""spook easily,"" and many so-called ""scary"" movies, including this one, never scared me, but (many of them) definitely thrilled me. Granted, I\'d seen _Saving Private Ryan_ a few months before, which probably gave me a strong stomach. Well, enough about my wild, albeit fun, childhood. How does _The Silence of the Lambs_ hold up all these years later? For me personally, _The Silence of the Lambs_ is every bit as good as it was the first time I saw it at five years old.\r\n\r\nOn the off chance you don\'t already know the plot by now, Jodie Foster stars as Clarice Starling, a rookie FBI agent with a degree in psychology who is called from training by her boss Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) in the middle of a string of murders by a man nicknamed ""Buffalo Bill"" (Ted Levine) who skins his victims, all of whom happen to be women. Crawford tells her to interview the psychotic Dr. Hannibal ""the Cannibal"" Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) in prison, hoping he might have an answer of some kind. Lecter brushes her off. After Catherine Martin (Brooke Smith), the daughter of a senator is kidnapped, Lecter agrees to give Starling information about Buffalo Bill on the condition that she tell him personal information about herself.\r\n\r\nIf I had to pick the greatest Best Picture Oscar winner ever, it would most likely be _The Silence of the Lambs_. Well-acted, well-written, and well-directed, it\'s definitely my favorite.\r\n\r\nLet\'s look at the acting to start. Jodie Foster, unsurprisingly, won a well-deserved Oscar for her performance as Starling. Foster plays Starling as a little scared yet strong at the same time, definitely not a coward as Julianne Moore later played the character in the movie _Hannibal_, and definitely not someone who would turn cannibal as Thomas Harris wrote the character as doing in the novel Hannibal. Movie or novel, in my honest opinion, the Clarice Starling depicted in _Hannibal_ is an insult to what this Clarice Starling stands for. As we find out about what\'s been nagging Starling since childhood, Foster plays it especially well where another actress may have overdone it.\r\nAnthony Hopkins, like Foster, won an Oscar for his performance as Lecter, and I speak for a lot of people, if not everybody, when I say it was also well-deserved. Hopkins plays Lecter as brilliant yet insane, making him one of the more interesting villains in movie history.\r\nScott Glenn plays Crawford very well for the time he\'s onscreen.\r\nTed Levine plays ""Buffalo Bill"" as straight up crazy, and does a very good job of making us hate him.\r\nBrooke Smith is only supposed to play Catherine Martin as scared and she does - with dead-on accuracy.\r\n\r\nTed Tally won a well-deserved Oscar for his screenplay, adapted from Thomas Harris\' novel of the same name. Tally doesn\'t feel the need to focus on violence and gore, which is one of the movie\'s strengths. Instead he focuses on the characters, and I\'d be lying if I said he didn\'t flesh them out very, very, very, well.\r\n\r\nJonathan Demme also won an Oscar for his directing and he does a very good job of it.\r\n\r\n_The Silence of the Lambs_ is relentlessly thrilling and it holds me to my seat until the last frame every time I see it, all without relying on excessive gore.\r\nI\'ve already mentioned that _The Silence of the Lambs_ doesn\'t scare me, so it may - or may not - scare you, depending on what you\'re afraid of. Admittedly, there are a few creepy things displayed onscreen so I can see why it would scare some viewers.\r\nEither way, I can\'t recommend _The Silence of the Lambs_ enough, and everybody should see it at least once.\r\n\r\n_The Silence of the Lambs_ is a childhood favorite of mine, and it holds up very, very well almost 25 years after its release. It\'s relentlessly thrilling, flawlessly acted, flawlessly written, flawlessly directed, and one of the few movies that actually deserved all the Oscars it won.', ""This is one of a few movies I put off reviewing for years, because I honestly don't know what to say about a film this classic. So I'll be brief in my actual review, knowing that it comes from a place where I honestly believe that this is a movie that deserves its praise:\r\n\r\nEven if the A-plot of the story wasn't one of the best crime thrillers put to screen, the Hannibal Lector moments alone would be enough to make _Silence of the Lambs_ a great movie, most especially his run in Memphis.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:★★★★ - Very strong appeal. A personal favourite._"", 'It kind of reminds me of The Rocky Horror Picture Show, because Frank and Jame are drag queens who kill.', ""As a genre fan, there's a certain amount of satisfaction when a film is recognized by mainstream audiences. That's what it was like for me in 1992 when <i>Silence of the Lambs</i> swept the Oscar's (Best Picture, Director, Actor and Actress). \r\n\r\nAnd boy did the movie deserve it. Jonathan Demme's fantastic retelling of the classic book by Thomas Harris. Anthony Hopkins' scene-chewing Hannibal Lecter turned him into a pop culture icon (and unfortunately a slew of middling sequels). And Jodie Foster's grim and naive portrayal of Clarice. \r\n\r\nThe final touch is that haunting score. Some of the best movies out there are elevated by a musical score that puts it another league. \r\n\r\nA phenomenal classic."", ""**Absolute Classic Film!\r\n I read the book before watching this thriller/horror classic film by Jonathan Demme. The film works on so many levels and at times feels very realistic in how it portraits law enforcers and the perverse criminals they pursue. Outstanding performances by Anthony Hopkins, Jodie Foster, Scott Glen, Ted Levine, etc.. I feel the director was influenced by Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho classic horror film by way of how grounded this film shows the deadly cat and mouse game and the overall arch of themes throughout.\r\n Fear and desire for sex, loathing of the human body, suppression of emotions, hatred for banality and towards women, etc. In this day of cartoon Marvel movies which have little or no connections to human experiences or reality, this classic film will stand the test of time because of how all of the creative artists involve respected the work. This one's on my all time top favorite list of must see films."", 'This is a brilliant screen adaptation of the Thomas Harris book with a cast impossible to improve upon. Anthony Hopkins plays ""Hannibal Lecter"", a murderous sophisticate with a penchant for eating the evidence and Jodie Foster as the novice FBI agent sent to try and elicit his help in tracking down a killer with a similar modus operandi to our now incarcerated ""Lecter"". The menace with which Hopkins portrays the role is spine-chilling. Foster conveys the transformation from scared young agent to hard-nosed detective with convincing aplomb and this really does make for a belter of a thriller. A clean sweep of 5 Oscars and the top 2 acting BAFTA awards can\'t be wrong!']"

There is still a bond, if one is hurt another, it means the one suffer itself as well."", 'Original title: Mononoke Hime\r\n\r\nThe film is set in the 14th Century during Japan’s Muromachi Period.\r\n\r\nYoung Prince Ashitaka, the last royal of his line, slays a wild boar that is about to attack his village. The boar, demonised because it was consumed by rage and hatred, infects the young Prince, who will eventually become demonised too.\r\n\r\nHe leaves the village to find a cure in the form of Shishigami, a deer-like god. On his journey he realises that the latent rage and hatred within him, when it surfaces, gives him enormous power – proven when he slices off the arms of a Samurai warrior and decapitates another one.\r\n\r\nOn his journey, he sees a travelling group of people attacked by a wolf pack. He saves two of the men who, it turns out, are from Irontown, run by the Lady Ishobi. He brings the two men back to Irontown, which is peopled by women who do the foundry-work and chores, and men who provide the security and protection, although even that is not cut and dried as the women are capable of defending themselves with guns being manufactured especially for them by the lepers to whom the Lady Ishobi provides food and dignity. There is much humour when the women verbally chastise their menfolk. I found those scenes hilarious.\r\n\r\nWhen Ashitaka brings the men back to Irontown he is welcomed by the Lady Ishobi. He also discovers that the wolf pack was led by the wolf god Moro, and the strange girl he saw help the wolves was San, the adopted daughter of Moro. San has the ability to talk to the nature spirits, and she is therefore known as Princess Mononoke (“Spirits of things”).\r\n\r\nAshitaka is concerned that Ishobi is destroying the forest. It turns out that the Lady Ishobi and Moro are in battle because of the damage being done to the forest.\r\n\r\nTo add to this, Ishobi has also recruited Samurai to help her in her fight, but the Samurai have two motives: one is to take the head of the Forest Spirit back to the Emperor, who believes it will give him immortality. The second is to take Irontown from the Lady Ishobi.\r\n\r\nThat is an abstract of the plot.\r\n\r\nMiyazaki used computer-generated graphics in this for the first time, but most of the film was generated by hand. This I think is to its benefit. The drawing is breathtaking in places, and the depiction of such supernatural events as the Forest Spirit changing into the Nightwalker and the scene of the demon-possessed boar when it emerges from the forest for the first time are spectacular.\r\n\r\nI think it’s too scary and bloody for children, but a friend assures me that this sort of film is par for the course for children in Japan.\r\n\r\nThe film is over two hours long, and it does pack a lot into that two hours. I found this film very interesting and watchable. I wanted to know what happened, and the plot was certainly not predictable. I believed in the world it depicted. I think in any film you have to allow it to draw you into its world (up to a point, some films are ludicrous and expect too much, this isn’t one of them).\r\n\r\nPart of the reason for the film’s ability to keep me interested is because the characters cannot be labelled “goodies” and “baddies.” Yes, Moro and his pack are attacking helpless workers, but they are destroying the forest and he needs to protect his way of life. Yes, the Lady Ishobi is destroying the forest, but she’s making a living for herself and is helping others: she has removed the women from servitude in brothels, given them security, work, and a home; some have found husbands or companions. She has provided shelter, home and work for the lepers, normally outcasts. Neither side seems particularly vindictive; Ishobi’s attempts to rid herself of the wolf pack are for self preservation, and her coalition with the Samurai to destroy the Forest Spirit is her attempt to remove the constant threat of attack. One can argue that if she took a more conciliatory view, maybe some sort of truce could be reached, but time and again members of the wolf pack merely say “they are humans, they must be killed” – to the point that even Ashitaki, who has helped the animals – is threatened with death if he does not leave the forest. In fact, one could argue that it is the animals who show a “racist” attitude here – demanding the death of the humans because they are humans. None of the humans in the film demand the death of the animals simply because they are animals. Their deaths, and the destruction of their habitat, are an unfortunate side-effect of the humans’ industrialisation, not a deliberate act.\r\n\r\nI hope that what you see from my analysis above is that the film is not goodies v. baddies. It’s nature v. industrialisation, and the compromise to that is not an easy one, and the film reflects that.\r\n\r\nYou’ll be happy to know the film does have an upbeat ending, but thankfully it’s not entirely predictable, in my opinion.\r\n\r\nI thoroughly recommend the film.', 'When a village is tormented by a wild boar, it falls to the young ""Ashitaka"" to sort it out. Turns out though, that it isn\'t an ordinary beast - and in the fight the man is afflicted with a curse that requires his journey to the great tree god to put right. His travels lead him to the unscrupulous ""Lady Eboshi"" who has developed a smelting process that enables her to make guns - giving her not only advantage against the other local clans, but also helping her on her quest to kill the gods and the wolves lead by the Princess Mononoke whom they have raised from infancy. The story is great, the colourful and detailed animation moves the fable along well and excitingly with plenty of solid characterisation and action a-plenty. As ever with Miyazaki, there is a moral to the story - and the last twenty minutes exemplify that beautifully. The English language dubbed version has a good cast injecting personality and an extra degree of emotion to the characters too. I did find the forest sprites just a bit too twee, but otherwise this is a great marriage of creativity and legend - and I really enjoyed it.', ""This is my favorite movie from Miyazaki. The visuals are great. The characters are great. The voice acting (English version) is great. The animation is great. Music is great. The story is good. Everything about this movie is so cool and it's just really fun to watch.""]"

The scenario reminded me a little of an episode of ""Columbo"" - a rather sterile, studio-set environment that came across as quite limiting. Once it gets going, though, it\'s one of the best crime thrillers I\'ve seen in ages. It all centres around the kidnapping of a small boy for whom the anger-prone, shoe millionaire ""Gondo"" (a strong contribution from Toshirô Mifune) is supposed to pay a ransom of ¥30 million - a colossal sum. It turns out, though, that it\'s not his son who has been snatched - it\'s the child of his chauffeur. Why ought he to pay? Will he just get on with his impending company takeover or will he risk bankruptcy for the young ""Shinichi""? This is a film split into three sections. The first deals with the decision making process around will he/won\'t he/why should he. Next, the police must try to apprehend this individual. This process is meticulously carried out and Kurosawa has chosen to immerse us in some of that detail, rather than just cursorily skip through it. This makes the whole detection process a much more interesting part of the film; allowing some aspects of the characterisation of the police officers to develop and also introducing some dark humour to the proceedings. Finally, we reach the denouement with it\'s own rather curious and not entirely explicable agenda. There\'s an element of ""what would you do?"", there\'s a grim depiction of a seamier side of Japanese (heroin-fuelled) culture that we seldom get to see and there is a rather starkly effective dose of humanity presented here as the story juggles aspects of human nature, nurture and good old fashioned greed in quite an effective fashion. It\'s based on an Ed McBain book (which I haven\'t read) but the entire project has been successfully subsumed into it\'s guest culture for a gripping and detailed mystery that flies by.', ""A well worked, high stake crime thriller. The stakes are deeply personal to our main characters and puts them in an impossible situation. The performances and direction are very solid, the story is engaging and ultimately, it's a simple yet enjoyable film.

A shame that the sequels did not live up to this one. \r\n\r\n- Ian Beale', 'Earth Angel And The Nuclear DeLorean.\r\n\r\nIt\'s 1984 and director Robert Zemeckis, fresh from the success of Romancing The Stone, is trying to film Back To the Future - a film about a young teenager called Marty McFly who is accidentally sent back in time to 1955 and inadvertently risks the future of his family. Zemeckis is troubled by his leading man, Eric Stoltz, who just isn\'t capturing the youthful teenager exuberance that he wants for Marty McFly. Stoltz is jettisoned and in comes Michael J. Fox who was busy wowing audiences in the hugely popular sit-com Family Ties. Fox had been first choice anyway but couldn\'t get a release slot from shooting with Family Ties. Luckily the wasted time with Stoltz created an opening for Fox to play Marty McFly as well as work on the show - the result of which would turn out to be one of the most beloved fantasy trilogies of the modern era.\r\n\r\nIt\'s honestly hard to find anyone who seriously doesn\'t like Back To The Future part one. The second one has its critics, because, lets face it, it\'s a bridge between two better films, while the third film loses some people because of its Western themed plot (the heathens that they are). Yet really this trilogy opener is as near perfect cinema for all the family as you could wish to view. It\'s a water tight script from Zemeckis and Bob Gale that not only encompasses witty time travel paradoxes, but also dares to be dramatic into the bargain. The first 15 minutes contains a real shocker that is as cheeky as it bold, something that really gives Marty\'s 1955 quest a real urgency that the audience can buy into as the comedy relief then comes in spades. The set pieces are first rate - hello skateboard - hello rock ""n"" roll 101, and the makers have fun in winking towards other notable sci-fi pictures along the way. Hell they even manage to deal in an Oedipal strand that is tasteful, handled superbly and garners guffaws aplenty. No mean feat that last one actually. Alan Silvestri provides a whirring & pleasing score and the theme song, The Power Of Love, by Huey Lewis & The News, is infectiously enjoyable. Finally it\'s the cast that seal the deal for why this is as good as it gets for fantasy escapist cinema. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Thomas F. Wilson & Crispin Glover are the perfect quintet, each feeding off each other and doing justice to the excellently constructed story.\r\n\r\nMade for $19 million, Back To The Future went on to make a worldwide gross of over $381 million, and those are the kind of figures you really can\'t argue with. It\'s snappy, happy and down right funny, so really, if you don\'t like Back To The Future then seek medical help immediately. 10/10', '""Robert Zemeckis remains the beating heart of modern science-fiction films""\r\n\r\nThe first time I have ever redacted a critic was down in 2015, since then, I learned how impressive productions could change lives and start movements throughout the world. Back To The Future represents one of those films, such a powerful, inspirational, comical, heartwarming, and innovative one. Probably, McFly and Doc Brown proffer the best duo-interaction I have ever beheld in an 80s film (which, happily, could end up being top-notch of all time). There are almost no blunders to be found because the flick essentially represents an instant classic of cinematic history as if to say, pure perfection. From this moment on, you might be thinking about the reason of having assessed the film as absolute perfection score.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, we discuss relating to breaking formulas and experiencing new paths, in other words, means opening new cinematic genres and improving them, that is to say, films which leave a significant legacy. Back To The Future follows the proper steps to provide that brand-new feature we were all hoping. Secondly, we balance the film\'s highest moments and ordinary moments with humour, some 50\'s nostalgia, some drama and (even) some action moments which results in a win-win the film provides a mixture of genres carefully well-managed and accurately-needed. Third, if the goal is the production of an instant classic, we will need to focus on the cast, because they are the ones who will perform during the whole film, they embody the heroes and villains; therefore, they become fundamental.

Fox and Christopher Lloyd are the film\'s core, as excellent as Vince Vaughn-Owen Wilson\'s 2005 Wedding Crashers, I daresay. \r\n\r\nFinally, but not least, the soundtrack and the environment, in spite of ending up being complementary, provides not only a trusting reality but an opportunity to show the audience the plot\'s main incidents. During the display, we will notice the most recurrent spots are the 80\'s and 50\'s at school, at traditional coffee shops and the streets, not forgetting the excellent pop-culture references introduced.\r\n\r\nThe audience ought to congratulate Robert Zemeckis\' mind and, also, the crucial support of his staff (one of whom was Steve Spielberg) owing to this masterpiece. The montage is proof that everyone who has an incredible imagination is capable of creating chef-d\'oeuvres, delivering the audience such an extraordinary time. What is more exhilarating is the fact that then-president Ronald Reagan loved the film to the point that he used famous BTTF quotes, for example, during his 1986 State of Union Adress.

A pop-idol. An actress. An X-rated model. Public image and its personifying echoes circulate around the world, adhering to the desires of endearing fans alike. But when their inspirational idol haphazardly shifts career, from pop sensation to dramatic actress, the psychosis of the modern consumer society ultimately changes with her. Saddened, angered and crazed. Mima’s abrupt persona altering career move may have developed maddened stalkers, including her fantastically imagined past self haunting the newly suppressed version.\r\n\r\nThe late Satoshi Kon was known for seamlessly blending fantasy with reality. Depicting an opaque blurred line between delusions and actualities. None more so, than in his exaggerated psychologically disturbed work in Perfect Blue. For many the art form of Japanese animation, commonly titled as “anime”, is cited as “childish”. “Anime is for losers” tweeted kickboxer Andrew Tate. Well, if like Mr. Tate you believe anime to be childish, I implore you to watch Perfect Blue. Without illustrating the voyeuristic nature of Murai’s narrative, it is the most accessibly invigorating piece of psychological stimulation, that is strictly aimed towards adults, to ever be constructed from this art form.\r\n\r\nThe complete metamorphosis of a character that questions her own perceived identity through inquisitional explicit acts of graphic nature. Exploring the psychosis of shared delusional disorder and the acute harassment of an obsessive stalker. Kon establishes a murder mystery whilst inciting the emasculation of a vulnerable female’s world. Male controllers, likened to manipulative deities of authoritative powers, are gradually weakened by a mysterious individual. Culminating into a twistingly fragmented climax that grants Mima the independence that she was repressed from.\r\n\r\nKon’s intelligence in foreshadowing, the drama series ‘Double Bind’ essentially replicating Mima’s regressive state of mind, allows the audience to question several aspects. He smartly manages to maintain the central mystery without deterring from Mima’s mental instability. He doesn’t stop there though. Kon refuses to relinquish thematic presence in every frame. Exploring the fragility of a rape victim and the traumatisation of such an explicitly heightened ordeal. The dangers of online anonymity and the tarnishing of existing careers. Challenging the extremities of art in all its mediums. The realism of Perfect Blue is what forces its story to be so utterly terrifying. It’s not just a psychological thriller. It’s horror.\r\n\r\nKon’s signature animation style is gloriously vibrant as always, with attentive detail towards realistic environments. The grotesque facial features of “Me-Mania”, only possible in this art form, heighten the natural malformed detest we have for him. Ikumi’s audacious score enables the heart to palpitate more frequently with its sharp tones and ethereal voices. And, as rare as this is, the English dub is surprisingly decent.\r\n\r\nThe reality is that Perfect Blue transcends the medium that it is presented in. It stimulates through Kon’s trademark visceral style, allowing the dangers of early Internet culture to produce a thrilling psychologically adept feature that blurs fantasy with reality. I mean, for a film to make me stand up, clap my hands and utter the words “perfection”, it has to be something special right?. Well, Perfect Blue is special, because it is perfect. And yes, with that said it does indeed garner the perfect rating. Quite possibly the best anime feature to ever be released.', ""I caught this in High School and it instantly took me as an eerie Alfred Hitchcock show that did an outstanding job of feeding on pure paranoia.\r\n\r\nIt was unsettling, it was scary, and at the time it seemed as realistic as it could be for an anime movie.\r\n\r\nAs I rode through it, I started doubting what was real and what wasn't and that is a hallmark of a great movie, that ability to keep the viewer on their toes."", 'The young ""Mima"" has a successful, if limited, career singing with a girl band, but she is restless. Her manager insists he can get her an acting job on a popular soap - and that\'s the way to fame and fortune. Like so many other impressionable young folks, she tries to follow her dream - but is really only following his, and is soon being photographed (intimately), denigrated and her grasp on reality is soon compromised. When things start to take an altogether more sinister turn, though, we start to wonder just who is responsible for a series of murders amongst those known to hold disparaging views on the young woman. Might she be developing some form of lethal schizophrenia or is she (and are they) really the victims of an over-zealous fan. At times this is actually quite harrowing. The plundering of her innocence by those both venal and neglectful of this young woman is writ large and is really quite depressing to watch. The story itself deals frankly with the unsavoury nature of not just exploitation, but of the pressures the constant search for success can put on a developing mind. This packs quite a lot to think about in in eighty minutes, and 25 years on is still a potent watch.', ""Perfect Blue, a cult anime film that remains as relevant today as it was when it was first released, follows the story of a teenage girl on the brink of insanity. Its exploration of unsettling themes such as consent and exploitation may make for uncomfortable viewing, but it's a stark reminder of the issues we still face. Despite some parts feeling dated, its prediction of the Internet as a tool for stalking and the rise of social media for harassment is particularly noteworthy.""]"

The script is written by Tom Schulman, based on his life at Montgomery Bell Academy, an all-boys preparatory school in Nashville, Tennessee. The film is set in 1959 at the fictional Welton Academy in Vermont (location shoot from St. Andrew's School in Middletown, Delaware). The story follows that of English teacher John Keating who uses his different method of teaching to inspire his students to be all that they can be whilst warning of the perils of conformity.\r\n\r\nDead Poets Society was a monster smash hit that made almost $220 million profit in Worldwide box office takings. Not bad considering this was the year that film lovers flocked to see the likes of Batman, Lethal Weapon 2 and the third outing for one Indiana Jones. It showed that there was a mainstream market for serious drama if it is done well. And rest assured, Dead Poets Society is done well, very well in fact. Its launchpad is Schulman's Academy Award winning script that puts under the microscope educational conformity and the ogres that are parental and peer pressure. Enter the inspired casting of Robin Wiliams (nominated for BAFTA & Academy Award for Best Actor) as the teacher who urges his charges to see outside of the box that they have been placed in. Young men, soon to be full adults, who have their lives mapped out for them, are challenged by Mr Keating to be spontaneous, to pursue idealism and view life with new perspectives.\r\n\r\nComing two years after he was nominated for Good Morning Vietnam, Williams once and for all proves to his doubters that he is a quality dramatic actor. His Keating is charismatic but without the mad-cap histrionics that Williams is famed for. Very controlled, in that what is in essence a catalyst role, Keating hasn't rushed to become said catalyst. He's a constant sympathetic presence, a father figure type, yet a confidential friend too. That Schulman's script has avoided the usual clichés that come with teacher-student relations in film's helps Williams as an actor to breath intelligent life into Keating. Even the flecks of humour that Williams is allowed to work from, such as Brando doing Shakespeare, play with a warmth that's essential to the relationships forming in the piece. Tho it's unquestionably Williams' movie (the film soars when he is on screen), the young cast playing the students get an A + for their sensitive portrayals. Notably Robert Sean Leonard (heartfelt), Ethan Hawke (haunting) & Gale Hansen (punky). While Kurtwood Smith leaves an indelible image as a domineering father.\r\n\r\nIn the hands of Weir, the film, unsurprisingly to his fans, carries an air of mysticism too. Again working with one of his regular DOP's, John Seale, Weir knows how to capture the time, place and people in his movies; while cloaking them in dashes of mystical beauty. Be it the boys striding around the school grounds amidst autumnal hues, or plodding wearily thru the snowy terrain as Winter kicks in, Weir gives the scenes an apt poetic quality. It's also of note that these scenes, as well as the cave sequences where the Dead Poets Society meetings take place, blend with the characters emotional states. Sprightly and optimistic around the greenery, nervous and excited in the darkened cave, then heavy of heart and leg as the fall accompanies the emotionally turbulent last quarter. A last quarter that leads to what has now become a divisive ending. Some have (and will) come away from it irked and claiming it to be syrupy. Others such as myself find it uplifting, hopeful and a fitting end to the emotional roller-coaster that cast and crew have taken us on. Is your glass half full or half empty? An excellent and intelligent story is directed and acted accordingly, with its themes making it actually one of the best Punk Rock movies out there. 9/10"", '_**Seize the day; be Exceptional!**_\r\n\r\nJohn Keating (Robin Williams), a new teacher at a stuffy prep school in 1959, inspires his students to capitalize on their natural talents and develop a passion for life because they only have one shot and in 60 years or so they\'ll all be worm-food. Each boy starts to act on Keating\'s dynamic ideas with explosive consequences , both good and bad.\r\n\r\nReleased in 1989 and directed by Peter Weir, ""Dead Poets Society"" is a coming-of-age drama that\'s one of the most inspiring films ever made and ranks with my all-time favorite movies. The film captivates from the very beginning and doesn\'t release until it\'s over. That\'s when you KNOW a movie\'s really good, regardless of the subject matter. The cinematography and locations are top rate, shot in the Middletown region of Delaware (although the story itself takes place in Vermont). The quiet Fall & Winter scenes are breathtaking.\r\n\r\nThis is not a spoiler, but there\'s a powerful scene at the climax where the students give Keating a daring final salute. Roger Ebert criticized the scene as ""so moving he wanted to throw up,"" but he\'s dead wrong. It is both unexpected and potent.\r\n\r\nThe film contains a wealth of riches to mine in subsequent viewings, and I don\'t just mean the insights conjured from the poetry & prose. Here are a handful off the top of my head: ""The letter kills,"" referring to the legalistic nature of Neil\'s joyless father and most of the teachers at the school; the type of Judas (Cameron); the scapegoat (Keating); the stunning nature of feminine beauty (when Chris appears at the entrance of the school and the guys\' mouths drop); the marvels of nature and how they\'re conducive to inspiration & spirituality; Keating\'s heartbroken countenance after Neil is removed from the theater crowd (Keating knows there\'s little he can do about the authoritarian mistreatment).\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of insignificant scenes that don\'t work so well, but that\'s always the case, even with the best of films.\r\n\r\nOne possible objection is that one boy\'s tragedy goes against the very message of the film to ""seize the day."" I disagree. The kid really started to ""seize the day"" but his passions were quenched by someone who didn\'t share Keating\'s mindset and he unfortunately couldn\'t handle it. Again, dynamic ideas have explosive consequences, good and bad. The other kids had varying results with their attempts to ""seize the day."" Some made progress in attaining their dreams and others got in trouble because they threw wisdom to the wind. The varying results make the story realistic.\r\n\r\nAnother criticism was voiced by a reviewer who stated that the late night meetings at the cave to read poetry and inspire one another were ""homo erotic."" This interpretation could only be derived by an adult in our gay-obsessed modern culture. The kids in the film are about 16-17 years-old. This was the only way they could go out and have fun under the strict rules of a New England prep school in 1959. I remember when I was a teenager going out to the treehouse with several guys and drinking & smoking; we\'d sometimes discuss metal/rock lyrics, which could be viewed as a delinquent form of poetry, and other such things. Sometimes we\'d bring a girl or three. Likewise, in two of the cave meetings in the film one of the guys brings a couple babes from another school whilst the others look on in awe; on two other occasions a guy brings nude pages of whoa-men. I think that pretty much quells the ""homo-erotic"" theory.\r\n\r\nMost of those who scoff at this film\'s message go back to their 9 to 5 slavery (or 3 to 11 or 11 to 7, etc.) with no light at the end of the mundane tunnel. I encourage such people to give the film a second look. But BEWARE, there are no moronic explosions, CGI, non-stop \'action,\' gore, OTT cussing, nudity or sex scenes; I know that\'s completely shocking, but it\'s true. Then I would encourage these people to take a good look at their lives and ask: Are you willing to change it? Throw off the shackles? Throw caution to the wind and pursue your true calling, your dream? Will you ""sieze the day""? Or will you continue to stagnate in a puddle of mediocrity? The answer that comes back will usually determine if this film becomes a favorite or not.\r\n\r\nFINAL ANALYSIS: Australian director Peter Weir has other good films like ""Witness"" and ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" (the latter is, incidentally, a film about an ALL-GIRLS school and can be boring if you\'re not in the mood for an ultra-mystery yarn), but ""Dead Poets Society"" is his best. Check it out. Give it a second (or third) chance if you haven\'t already. It\'s an outstanding story and it\'ll inspire you, especially if you\'ve fallen into a life-stifling, growth-stultifying rut of drudgery.\r\n\r\nThe film runs just over two hours (128 minutes).\r\n\r\nGRADE: A+', 'Robin Williams (""Keating"") arrives at an all boys school where he is to teach them English. As you\'d expect, they weren\'t particularly interested, but when he begins by telling them to rip up the poetry manual, and continues with an inspirational and vocational approach the pupils start to engage not only with him, but they set up the eponymous club which helps each of them to develop as a person. This is quite a task for the shy young ""Todd"" (easily the most effective performance of Ethan Hawke\'s career) and for aspiring actor ""Neil"" (a terrifically measured and sincere Robert Sean Leonard) who is struggling to reconcile his own desires with those of his loving, but over-bearing, father who wants him to go to Harvard and become a lawyer. This is a terrific character based drama with Williams on great form, but he features quite sparingly - the thrust of this potent, funny and thought-provoking narrative rests with the young men. Their ensemble effort exposes a myriad of layered teenage foibles from trauma to Tennyson; Shakespeare to sex (or sax!) - with well written and delivered dialogue that focuses poignantly and cleverly on their maturing personalities. This film is highly recommended.', 'The (very absurd) point of view of the rich people about freedom.\r\n\r\nThe Movie is so pathetically formulaic that it makes you want to throw tomatoes at the screen.\r\n\r\nThe Horatian ideal, of Stoic-Epicurean origin, of a life enjoyed in the good it gives us, even if it is little, is here often repeated, inaccurately, as an invitation to live joyfully.\r\n\r\nAnd it makes us laugh and reflect even more that it is observed from an ""even higher"" point of view than the already very high social class of the characters.', '""Dead Poets Society"" never endeavours to sweeten the bitter pill of disappointment or tragedy by playing to whatever cliched expectations you might have. Neil\'s father Mr. Perry isn\'t going to suddenly relent and admit what a stupid and selfish fool he has been and then decide to change his uncompromising viewpoint in relation to his son\'s disputed future. He actually becomes even more entrenched in his stubborn determination that his son will live his life the way he wants it lived. However, this film isn\'t content to end on such a desperately dispiriting note as Neil\'s tragic suicide, so it returns to the original stance championed by Keating throughout when some of his now former students stand on their desktops in an act of defiant solidarity and also as a final salute to their departing captain. They now have the potential to see life from a completely different angle than the rest of us because of him and that is precisely what a solid education is supposed to do. It is the precious gift of being able to think and reason and draw intelligent and well informed conclusions for yourself on any number of various subjects.']"

The story is told through two threads: one looks at the end of the old gent\'s life from his own perspective; the second takes a retrospective view from the wake as his family and colleagues gather to remember him. Kurusawa is clearly making a point with this delicate, poignant film - perhaps life needs to be appreciated and enjoyed - not necessarily in a jovial, happy fashion, but by achievement. In this case ""Watanabe"" sets about using his position to help locals get a park, but he also starts an empowering relationship (platonic) with a younger girl, who is quite keen on her food, it has to be said. As his colleagues at the wake suffer from excesses of saké their traditionally stiff, reserved, view of their late friend becomes more of a tool to evaluate their own roles and purpose as they determine to be more like him....

And the same for the later scenes with the young woman.

The scene of dancers shot through bead curtains swinging in time to the music was brilliant.  His choice of Miki Odagiri for muse is brilliant. Her laugh is infectious.

She doesn’t care for any of these people except her brother. One day, she returns home from getting the groceries to find corrupt DEA agents have killed her entire family. Key amongst those agents is Stansfield, played by Gary Oldman. Seeking refuge in the flat of a neighbour she had befriended earlier, Léon (Jean Reno), she learns that he is a hitman. She makes a deal with him: she will look after the flat by doing the domestic chores if he will teach her how to get revenge on the men who killed her brother.\r\n\r\nStrange though the synopsis may be, the relationship between Léon and Mathilda is kept innocent, and the scenes between the two are believable. Mathilda’s sexual awareness is at a nascent stage and her exposure to the sordid side of life with her recently deceased family (her step-father worked for drug-dealers) means she is perhaps not as innocent as most 12-year old girls; however, Léon is unwilling to take advantage of the situation. This means the story can focus on the platonic relationship between the two, the bond that develops between them, and how each affects the other’s life.\r\n\r\nAlthough it may seem a little far-fetched that a young girl would accompany a hitman during his work, Léon ensures that her assistance is required only on fairly routine hits that follow a well-defined pattern. For the more complex hits he leaves her behind.\r\n\r\nThere is a thread of humour running through the film, but you must bear in mind the film is framed in the world of corruption and greed and all is not sweet and light, and graphic violence is depicted.\r\n\r\nJean Reno is wonderful as the extremely good but placid hitman, whose whole outlook on life is changed by the young Mathilda, played wonderfully by Natalie Portman in her first film.

Drawing on the public perception of the similarities between himself and Adolf Hitler - not just his toothbrush moustache but also their upbringings - Chaplin sought to directly parody and attack the German führer and fascism.\r\n\r\nIn _The Great Dictator_, Adenoid Hynkel (Chaplin) rules Tomania and sets about his conquest of the world. In doing so, he persecutes Jewish people, including a former veteran of World War I who is now a barber (also Chaplin).\r\n\r\nUnsurprisingly, the film was a hit on release, resonating well with the anti-Nazi sentiment in both American and British public. Chaplin understood that delivering his political message was so important that he forewent his usual desire for a silent film in order to get his message across.\r\n\r\nSound is used to great effect in _The Great Dictator_. By studying many of Hitler\'s speeches, Chaplin was able to create a ludicrous, yet believable, gibberish parody of the Nazi leader\'s oratory style. \r\n\r\nOf course, the physical comedy remains, typically reserved for the barber (who may or may not be Chaplin\'s silent hero, The Tramp). This combination of physical comedy and irreverent one liners together makes the film feel like a very early Carry On.\r\n\r\nWhile _The Great Dictator_ remains arguably Chaplin\'s best ""talkie"", it often feels like it is the end of Chaplin\'s era of classical pantomime. People being hit on the head with a saucepan comes across as a cheap laugh and it is often the verbal jokes that are the cleverest. Overall the comedy has not aged well.\r\n\r\nBut _The Great Dictator_ was never designed for longevity. It was perfect propaganda for the Allies, released at a perfect point in the War. For that reason, The Great Dictator can only be judged in the context of its release.']"

Not only does it show us a lot about the world of Hollywood during its golden age, but it also reveals a lot about the actors' egos, vanities and their titanic struggles to preserve their careers and stay in the limelight. Brilliantly directed by Billy Wilder, it is considered by many to be one of the great movie classics, combining entertainment, artistic value and cultural relevance. In 1951, it won three Oscars (Best Screenplay, Best Art Direction in a Black and White Film, Best Comic Film Soundtrack) and could perfectly have won one more, for Best Actress. But awards like these are never completely fair, especially in years so fertile for good films.\r\n\r\nStarting with the iconic scene of the dead man in the pool, the film intrigues us, and curiosity grips us, as the film shows how it all happened, introducing us to an average screenwriter who struggles to write a successful script that can leverage his career. He owes money, is in serious trouble and takes advantage of the opportunity to earn some easy money at the expense of a retired silent film actress, who decides to hire him to revise and type a script, written by herself and designed to mark her return. The script is mediocre, and he knows that the film will never happen, but he is coerced into silence, becoming the privileged eyewitness of the former star's gradual loss of lucidity. Of course, things get complicated as he loses his individual freedom and becomes more dependent on the whims and desires of his mistress.\r\n\r\nDespite the fiction, the film is based a lot on several loose true facts: one of them, the most obvious, is the fall of several actors in the course of the transition from silent to talking films. There were great actors who looked magnificent on screen and had great physical and facial expression, but who didn't survive this transition due to things as prosaic as a poor English fluency or a strange accent. Others, however, simply did not know how to understand and adapt to the novelty. The collapse of their careers and personal lives led to alcoholism, drugs, mental disorders. The film is able to condense almost all of this into a single character: Norma Desmond, the epitome of the fallen star.\r\n\r\nThe cast has several well-known names, three of which – William Holden, Erich Von Stroheim and, obviously, Gloria Swanson – offer us the interpretation of their lives and their work of greater value and recognition. Of course, we cannot ignore that Swanson was a great star of silent cinema and that she shone in films like “Trespasser” or “Indiscreet”, and that Holden would continue to be a highly sought actor after this, having won his Oscar for Best Actor in a film that starred two years later. But there is no doubt that this film immortalized the three of them.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film is impeccable, and the merit lies a lot in the brilliance of the dialogues, in the excellence of the conception and development of the characters, in the extraordinary way in which Wilder managed to get the best out of Swanson and lead the actress to a magnificent performance, which has so much to brilliant and difficult as well as provocative (especially from the point of view of many Hollywood shooting stars, who saw themselves in character and felt offended by it). With an excellent pace, the film does not waste time or let the atmosphere of tension and drama fall into a standstill. The mansion, owned by the Getty family, acquires character by itself as it becomes the most obvious symbol of the disturbed personality and only of its resident. The black and white cinematography is magnificent, and accentuates, in its details and shooting angles, the dramatic feel of the film. The soundtrack isn't memorable, but it's effective and functional."", '""Gillis"" (William Holden) is a down-at-heel script writer who is struggling to keep his head above water. Not having had any successes for a while, his car is about to be repossessed and his erstwhile boss ""Sheldrake"" (Fred Clark) has nothing for him. On the run from the pursuing repo men, he turns his car into the drive of a decaying old mansion. Hiding his car in the garage, he is mistaken by the house\'s owner for an undertaker - she has a small matter that needs attending too! Realising her error she demands he leave, but not before he mentions what he does for a living. She has a script. Hundreds of pages of script - and she offers him a job, champagne and caviar if he will edit and refine it so ""Norma Desmond"" (Gloria Swanson), a retired former silent movie star, can present it to her favourite director Cecil B DeMille and restart her glorious career. Initially just seeing dollar signs, he agrees and what now ensues is a masterfully crafted story of love, dependency, ambition and delusion in which Swanson absolutely shines. It\'s clear to us from the outset that her grasp on reality is somewhat limited, and but for her dedicated factotum ""Max"" (Erich von Stroheim) she might well have fallen victim to her own depression many years ago. Holden is also on solid form here, his initial selfishness starts to morph into something more, he begins to care for this woman whose head is increasingly in the clouds, and upon whom she is becoming more reliant. The dialogue is delivered via a mix of Holden\'s quite honest narrative and the conversations between the characters delivering some of the best lines in cinema - ""I\'m still big - it\'s the world that\'s got smaller!"". The mental decline and instability of ""Desmond"" is expertly displayed here by a star who new a thing or two herself about the silent film scene, and who brings her facial expressions, her mannerisms and her generally star-studded demeanour to bear really effectively as the audience gradually realise that nothing here is going to pan out as it seems - or as anyone wants. Von Stroheim underplays his supporting role with aplomb and though I didn\'t really love the sub-plot with Nancy Olson\'s ""Betty Schaefer"" - it took away from the intensity of the main storyline - it did to serve to illustrate just how powerful jealousy can be. This is a super film, that still captivates on a big screen and is really well worth sitting down to watch.,', ""Ace! <em>'Sunset Boulevard'</em> is a splendid flick from 1950.\r\n\r\nI will note that I found the middle to be ever so slightly less interesting than the beginning and ending, though even so overall I most definitely enjoyed watching it. Love the dialogue, the score is excellent too. William Holden and Gloria Swanson are tremendous together onscreen, in what is a supremely well told story.""]"

I read a criticism that some scenes run long with agonizingly lengthy close-ups, but I found the cinematography intriguing. Those shots divulge nearly as much into the characters' personalities as a wad of dialogue from older traditional westerns. \r\n\r\nSometimes in a spaghetti western I find myself thinking, aw, why did that innocent person have to die, but innocents did die in the old west, I imagine. I am sure there was a lot of senseless violence then, just as there is now. And Bronson seemed like an odd choice as hero to me, though who can question a director who had the instinct to make perennial good guy Henry Fonda the ultimate villain? He didn't suck in this role, did he? And at least we get some back story with the harmonica playing Bronson character, unlike with old Blondie from Leone's The Good The Bad and the Ugly.\r\n\r\nAnd if you like the soundtrack, check out a YouTube video by The Danish National Symphony Orchestra And watch how they recreated the various parts of the music. It is pretty neat and just eight minutes long.\r\n\r\nSo yeah, I think Once Upon a Time in the West is a western classic, a Greek tragedy with spurs. So shoot me (at ten paces)."", 'I can\'t say that this script doesn\'t play on Clint Eastwood\'s ""Man with No Name"" (which Sergio Leone also directed), but it\'s not important. If you\'re a spaghetti western fan, this film is a step up. The idea of putting Fonda in a bad guy role, and casting Bronson as anti-hero was a little shocking at first. At the end, I see how it worked to film\'s advantage by making all the characters more complex, ambiguous and real. If you were a Clint Eastwood, you\'ll love this film.', 'The worst of the worst Leone Westerns.\r\nLeone destroyed the Westerns with his garbage, but the blame goes on to the critics who praised his lack of motivation, lack of inspiration, lack of credibility, lack of entertainment value, lack of strategy, just a total lack.\r\nThis is the worst of his stupid Westerns. It\'s the most contrived of his contrived Westerns.\r\nIt\'s another ""classical Greek hero"" story of gods, demigods, and cannon fodder. The more of a homicidal maniac you are, the more of a god you are. Great message.\r\nHere, we have a traditional Greek demigod hero who is out for revenge, the usual Hollywood formula.\r\nHe wants to kill Frank, whose only motivation is sadistic killing, because Fank killed his brother.\r\nSo, what does our traditional hero do? He kills everyone else but Frank, including men who are trying to kill Frank (Henry Fonda).\r\nI told you it was stupid, and that there was no way to buy into the motivation for the characters.\r\nThis one is the dumbest of the dumb Westerns. What\'s more, it\'s also worse because of all the waste. Why waste actors like Fonda, Robards, Bronson, Elam, and Strode on this stupid screenplay?', '**One of the great western movies.**\r\n\r\nWestern movies made in co-production by Italians and Americans (called ""spaghetti-western"") have been considered among the best that emerged within their genre, cleverly combining the tough action of Wild West gunslingers with the taste for raw realism and detail of the Italian filmmakers. I believe that such a thing may displease North Americans, who consider the cowboy a figure that is ""true USA"". I therefore invite them to visit the Brazilian city of Barretos, or the rural areas of Goiás, Mato Grosso or Tocantins in Brazil. There are plenty of cowboys there… they just lack the guns.\r\n\r\nSergio Leone is an unavoidable figure here, having been responsible for the greatest “spaghetti” ever made. In this film, he gives us again a remarkable job, full of qualities. I don\'t consider it the best of his career or the best ""spaghetti western"" ever made, but it definitely has a place on the podium. The film begins very well, with the massacre of an Irish immigrant and his family, which leaves in the hands of a second wife – yes, the man was secretly a bigamist – a few acres of uninteresting desert... but there are people willing to kill for it. It happens that the smart Irishman had bought the only viable land for the railroad, and had even acquired the right to build a station and a new settlement! In the middle, we still have a gunslinger in search of personal revenge and another, in the pay of the railroad itself.\r\n\r\nLet\'s face things frankly: the movie is good. It\'s a classic in its own right, almost mandatory for any movie lover, which doesn\'t mean that it\'s mandatory to like it! It is not a perfect film, it has problems that we will talk about, but it is equally endowed with characteristics and qualities that deserve to be valued.\r\n\r\nThe cinematography is very elegant, with good light and color. The sets and costumes are beautiful, even if it is frankly difficult to set a date to the film. In addition to the fact that the script does not establish a rigorous chronology, it\'s clear that the concern of the production designer and costume designers was aesthetics rather than historical rigor because there is a mixture of props, clothing and objects from the 1870s, 1880s and 1860. Is it a minor problem? Yes, but it is still a problem and a sign of the carelessness with which many productions are still facing historical rigor nowadays. The visual and special effects are put to good use and the soundtrack, atmospheric and truly impactful, is one of Ennio Morricone\'s most powerful works. Unfortunately, the film\'s editing was not the best, with cuts so abrupt and violent that it almost leads one to believe that the film was cut ""a posteriori"" for some reason. And perhaps the biggest problem turns out to be its excessively slow and annoying construction, with each scene lasting three minutes longer than necessary and the general length reaching three hours unnecessarily.\r\n\r\nWe can only say good things about the cast: among a vast succession of unknown and unimportant Italians, there are some outstanding actors who do not disappoint us and give us magnificent interpretations. Charles Bronson is a good-hearted tough guy with a monstrous charisma that steals our attention whenever he appears. Henry Fonda is effective as a villain, showing the actor\'s enormous versatility. Claudia Cardinale, one of the muses of cinema at the time, combines an impressive resilience of spirit, a high dose of charisma and a beauty that is still remembered today. Jason Robards has the difficult task of being the helpful good guy who ends badly to glorify the hero, but he takes the opportunity to show all his value as an actor.', 'Great western that I never watched despite owning the old DVD, but with Paramount releasing this on 4K UHD, decided to sit down through the 165-minute duration and it was a wonderful experience. Great performances all around, but most notably Jason Robards and Charles Bronson. Just another homerun from Sergio Leone though I think I prefer ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" but it\'s close. **4.5/5**']"

I bring this up because, as I\'ve aged, I\'ve come to see that I\'M Kurtz in some ways -- operating ""out there"" beyond the parameters and restrictions typically linked to my work.\r\n\r\nThe script was written by John Milius with alterations by Coppola as he shot the film whilst the narration was written by Michael Herr. The meaning of the story is obvious: The trip up the river led by Capt. Willard exposes him to two extreme viewpoints of war represented by the two colonels he encounters on his long journey, both of whose names start with \'K,\' which is no accident:\r\n\r\nLt. COL. KILGORE (Duvall) is a romantic who embraces war as a lifestyle and even feeds off it, i.e. glorifies it. The fact that he\'s a romantic can be observed in the air-raid on the village where he literally plays Wagner as a prologue. He feeds off the war to the extent that he ""loves the smell of napalm in the morning."" War is just another day to him so why not go surfing? Since he lives off of the war there\'s no way it can kill him or even give him a scratch. Kilgore naturally has the support of the top brass because he\'s part of the system and plays the game of war. \r\n\r\nCOL. KURTZ (Brando), by contrast, sees through this hypocrisy. He realizes that being in a state of war is humanity gone mad. It\'s living horror and therefore must be ended through the quickest means possible at whatever cost. He refuses to play the game of war as he expertly takes out double agents, etc. Of course the brass can\'t have this so they put out a hit on Kurtz via Willard. The existential Kurtz becomes increasingly disillusioned -- even crazy -- after jumping ship from the system and now has no sanctuary. Death is the only way out. His consolation is that Willard will tell his son the truth. \r\n\r\nThe ""Redux"" version was put together by Coppola and released in 2001 with the addition of 49 minutes of material that he originally cut, not to mention placing Clean\'s surfing scene later in the story.\r\n\r\nCoppola made the right decisions with his original 1979 edit of the film (2 hours, 33 minutes) since the extra footage of ""Redux"" tends to drag the film down with 1 or 2 scenes being dubiously scripted, e.g. the theft of Kilgore\'s surf board. Not every idea that is birthed during the creative process is worthy of the final product and ""Redux"" illustrates this. Thus the new footage of ""Redux"" should\'ve arguably been relegated to the ""deleted scenes"" section.\r\n\r\nThat said, I\'ve warmed up to ""Redux"" and feel it\'s a worthy version of the film, but only _if_ you\'ve watched the Theatrical Cut and **want more**. ""Redux"" successfully fleshes out the characters and gives them more dimension, especially Willard and Kurtz. Plus the sequence involving Kurtz reading a couple of TIME magazine articles illustrates beyond any shadow of doubt that he _wasn\'t_ insane and that the brass simply slandered him as crazy in order to justify the assassination of a decorated American officer.\r\n\r\nCoppola\'s preferred cut of the film is the ""Final Cut,"" released in 2019, which runs a half hour longer than the Theatrical Cut. In other words, it trims the fat off of ""Redux."" There\'s also a ""First Assembly"" version, a bootleg, that runs 4 hours, 49 minutes.\r\n\r\nThe film was shot in the Philippines. \r\n\r\nGRADE: A+', ""It wasn't just insanity and murder, there was enough of that to go around for everyone.\r\n\r\nApocalypse Now is directed by Francis Ford Coppola who also co-adapts the screenplay with John Milius from Heart of Darkness written by Joseph Conrad. It stars Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, Laurence Fishburne, Dennis Hopper, Harrison Ford, Frederic Forrest, Sam Bottoms and Albert Hall. Cinematography is by Vittorio Storaro and the music is primarily arranged by Carmine Coppola.\r\n\r\nThe Vietnam War and Captain Benjamin L. Willard (Sheen) is approached by American intelligence to go on a secret assignment: he's to follow the Nung River into the remote Cambodian jungle to find and assassinate Colonel Walter E. Kurtz (Marlon Brando), a member of the US Army Special Forces who has gone insane.\r\n\r\nOne of the most talked and written about films of all time, Apocalypse Now remains to this day a harrowing and haunting experience to first time viewers. With a production shoot that has in itself become legendary, Coppola's flawed masterpiece has been dissected and argued over to within an inch of its magnificent life. People will continue to write about it for ever more it seems, perhaps there might even be the odd new confrontational spin on what resides within? But ultimately it's what the individual takes away from the film that matters, our own interpretations key to the enjoyment of such a disturbing vision of war and violence.\r\n\r\nMany of the set-pieces, dialogue and characters have long since passed into folklore, and rightly so. The Ride of the Valkyries helicopter assault, Kurtz's surreal death camp, the boat people massacre, purple haze, the playmates, Kilgore, and of course the horror, the horror..indeed. The performances match the quality of Storaro's sumptuous Philippines photography, Sheen is fiercely committed and Duvall and Hopper in turn are powerhouse and edgy. While Brando, doing his own bizzaro thing in the last third, brings a little chaos unintentionally in keeping with the madness at the heart of this particular darkness.\r\n\r\nPersonally that last draggy third does stop it from being a complete genius type whole, but everything up to it is so damn good it's arguably churlish to expect perfection? But as near perfection movies go, Apocalypse Now proudly sits with the best of them, sitting there with a harrowed look upon its face. 9/10"", 'This is, I think, the definitive Vietnam war movie. Martin Sheen is ""Capt. Willard"", a war weary veteran who is sent on a top secret mission to track down and stop the rogue Colonel \'Kurtz"" (Marlon Brando) who is operating independently from Cambodia. With only a small crew of rookie squaddies, he sets off along the treacherous Nung River where, along the way, they alight on ""Kilgore"" (Robert Duvall) and face all sorts of dangers against both man and nature as they seek their quarry. The sheer intensity of the journey, and of the challenges it throws up cause ""Willard"" to re-evaluate his whole perspective, and not just on the war, as the horrors of this conflict manifest before him. It\'s a stunningly strong depiction of war; the humanity and vulnerability of the characters - even those who are outwardly strong - and the casting is inspired. It\'s bloody and gory at times, but never gratuitously and the closely shorn Brando is in a class of his own as the megalomaniac ""Kurtz"". Though fictional in fact, it doesn\'t pull it\'s punches and leaves us all with a bitter taste in our mouth and some seriously thought-provoking questions.']"

I just saw it for the first time myself a couple weeks before last Christmas, and I loved it.  It\'s an uplifting, inspiring, dramatic, and at times laugh-out-loud funny story, with a cast that probably couldn\'t be improved upon if you tried.  And, of course, it\'s directed by the superb Frank Capra, whose work I greatly admire.  James Stewart gives a raw, totally honest performance, as the unforgettable George Bailey, who on Christmas Eve is shown exactly why the world, or at least Bedford Falls, can\'t do without him.  And, there is my favorite line in the whole movie, out of so many memorable quotes, delivered perfectly by Lionel Barrymore, as the evil Mr. Potter: ""And a happy new year to you.  In jail!""', 'Oh my goodness, I am not going to spend much time describing this gold standard of Christmas movies. If you have seen it, you know what it is. If you haven’t seen it, stop reading this and watch it now. It is funny, tense, sentimental, romantic and downright Capra-esque.\r\n\r\nI have liked Jimmy Stewart in everything I have seen him in. Was he that good, or did the camera just plain love him, like I heard said once about Steve McQueen. But it doesn’t stop there. If you notice the ensemble cast, you see represented some of the finest character actors out there. Between them it’s seems like we have seen one of them in every great classic movie.\r\n\r\nI don’t watch this every year any more - there is just too much to see out there this time of year. But I watch it every two or three years and besides, if I have some time to spare, I can practically review every scene in order in my mind. It is part of my Christmas consciousness. Wait, are you still reading this?', ""Lovely film.\r\n\r\n<em>'It’s a Wonderful Life'</em> is enjoyable, hearty and well crafted. It takes longer than I would've predicted to get to 'the event', but it's very much worth seeing the journey that comes before - as we see the arc of James Stewart's George. It all crescendos with an ending that you can't help but smile at.\r\n\r\nStewart is excellent in the lead role, you really do see every single emotion that his character goes through. He is, by far, the standout performer, but there are of course good performances from the likes of Donna Reed (Mary), Lionel Barrymore (Henry) and Henry Travers (Clarence).\r\n\r\nI did notice a few weird cuts in there, not that I hold that against it or did it affect my enjoyment - it's just noticeable. I see, via other reviewers, that there's a colour version - Channel 4 showed the black-and-white version over here in the UK. I can't say I felt the need for colour, which is always a good sign.\r\n\r\nWholesome. Not that it, evidently given the average rating, needs to be said by someone like me, but: I'd certainly recommend this."", 'Every now and again you come across a film that just makes you think.... This is one of those. Recently upconverted to 4K and back on a big screen, it\'s quite simply a joy to watch. Jimmy Stewart is ""George"" - a man who has spent his adult life tirelessly trying to help those less fortunate to make their own way in life - and his savings and loan enterprise is the lifeline for many of them. When that all goes pear-shaped though, he feels a degree of despair that leads him to wish he had never been born. Enter the wonderful Henry Travers as ""Clarence"" - the visiting angel who grants his wish and demonstrates just how life would have looked had he, indeed, never been around. Lionel Barrymore is superb as his domineering competitor ""Mr. Potter"" who wants his name on everything in ""Pottertown"" that he doesn\'t already own. Donna Reed also shines as his wife, especially towards the end of this Capra masterpiece that uses shadow and the wintry weather to elicit a lovely sense of Christmas, but also of our innate need for warmth and security. It is sentimental, but not in a cloying fashion and the star works his magic, with a wonderful accompaniment from Dimitri Tiomkin, for over two hours that simply flies by. Well worth the restoration - not just of the film, but of our own faith in the human spirit - and watch, too!', ""I am not one of those snobs that thinks Black and White is always better... but don't watch the colored version of it, there is something about it that just doesn't look right.  Maybe it's because the colors are off, maybe because I'm not as used to it, but something doesn't sit right with it.\r\n\r\nAnyway, still the best Christmas movie ever made.  It's still about redemption.  It's still heartwarming and family friendly and... perfect... \r\n\r\n... perfect save some of the hard cuts.  I don't know why people don't mention those.  They are pretty glaring, they are pretty horrible.\r\n\r\nBut... it's still just about the best Christmas movie ever made."", ""It's a timeless and great film for everyone, straightforwardly telling us that life is worth living and a good deed is never lost.\r\n\r\nFrank Capra's films always remind me the world is not so bad. He shows us there is no need to beat or convince evil people to change. You will still have people helping you not from a sense of obligation but from a genuine willingness as long as you are kind and honest with them. In such a beautiful world, someone will impress you with their kindness and bring out yours, and vice versa. That's enough, isn't it?""]"

Someone must take the fall... \r\n\r\nWithdrawn from circulation in France at one time, unreleased in Spain as well, Paths of Glory is a shattering indictment on military hierarchy. On those General types who watch from afar through telescopic sights as men and boys are led like lambs to the slaughter, then off they go to their dinning rooms to gorge on wine and wholesome meat, the stench of rotting flesh as bad on their breaths as it is out there in no man's land. But it's OK for the war effort, while there might even be a promotion for some lucky soul in nice trousers...\r\n\r\nA two-parter, the film was adapted from the novel written by Humphrey Cobb. The first half follows the craziness of the attack, the horrors of war brutally realised as Kubrick and cinematographer Georg Krause bring out the worry and simmering anger that jostle for the soldier's souls. The camera is cold and calculating, thus perfect for the material to hand, it leads the viewers - with skillful fluidity - through the bleakness of the trenches and the desolation of no man's land, the former a foreboding place, the latter an atrocity exhibition as bodies get flayed and shattered, while others retreat with limbs or sanity barely intact.\r\n\r\nSecond part shifts to a legally based procedural as the Generals conspire to make an example of those who retreated. Cowardice and a dereliction of duty apparently means the firing squad must save the integrity of the army. Patsies are lined up, but their Colonel (a superb Kirk Douglas) wants to defend them, there's much sweat, tears and anger, accusations hurled, and mistakes once again proving insurmountable. Which leads to the astonishing finale, heartbreaking whilst inducing fury, and crowned by an elegiac song that brings tears for characters and viewers alike.\r\n\r\nA monochrome masterpiece full of technical skills, towering performances and writing to die for, Paths of Glory, candidate for one of the greatest anti-military films ever crafted. 10/10"", '""Col. Dax"" (Kirk Dougas) is cajoled by ""Gen. Broulard"" (Adolphe Menjou) into taking his Great War weary regiment on one last mission in occupied France. Frankly, it\'s little better than a suicide one, but his operational commander ""Gen. Mireau"" (George Macready) is determined at all costs that they succeed. Let battle commence! Only the French soldiers quickly realise that they are facing a well armed, immovable, German opponent and are either killed or driven back. Desperate to motivate his men, ""Mireau"" gives an order that is luckily not acted upon and with the mission deemed a failure and many of the men now in the relative safety of their trenches, the general orders a court martial for cowardice of three of the survivors. ""Dax"" is appalled but a trial there must be... Are the right people being tried and is the outcome a mere formality? I saw a 16mm print of this rather gripping and depressing wartime drama and it augmented the genuine sense of peril faced by these men as incoming artillery, the claustrophobic trench existences and - make no mistake - the competencies of their officers are put on display for us. It\'s dark, wet, gritty and as we reach the denouement clearly illustrative of the futility of much of this stage of this war. Kirk Douglas takes top billing and is adequate, it\'s Macready who actually steals this for me and the director\'s wife does the briefest of scenes as a German cabaret singer, too. Again, I think cinema will focus this better than television, but either way it\'s a thought-provoking exposé of war that holds up well 60-odd years later.', ""**A short and objective film, with a clear and still relevant message, as well as a huge performance by Kirk Douglas.**\r\n\r\nThere are several films about World War I, but it is far from being seen by the public as one of the best. In fact, it seems to me a little forgotten today. It is, however, timely and current in its pacifist message in which the greatest absurdity of war is emphasized in a partially true story, in which a group of three French soldiers is shot by cowardice after joining an inglorious attack to a much stronger and prepared German position.\r\n\r\nStanley Kubrick is a director to which no one gets indifferent: either if he loves or hates. He seems to have enjoyed fostering this by choosing hard themes, uncomfortable and debatable movies. This is just one more, and I, who loved some of his movies just as I hated others, decided to put this movie in the middle of the table. It is much more direct and easy to understand than most of his later work, but is nonetheless uncomfortable for the questions raised. For example, the contrasts between the ordinary soldier, mud in a trench and subject to die like an animal, and the generals, kilometers in the rear, in beautiful palaces where there is not a single shot. Intelligently, Kubrick focuses on the obvious injustice of punishment as proof of the inhuman absurdity of war and military leaders.\r\n\r\nThus, the movie is simple, direct, short (not even one and a half hours) and abrasive. Black-and-white cinematography is very clear, luminous and works a lot of light and shadow. The edition is effective and the soundtrack almost imperceptible for discretion. The sets and costumes are worthy of a large production. However, there are no action and combat scenes do not focus on the intensity of the fight, but its most human side. It is another perspective of war: those looking for action will not have what they want, but who wants a deeper movie has a full plate here.\r\n\r\nKirk Douglas is the protagonist, embodying a colonel who is responsible for carrying out the defense of the military under trial. The efforts he desperately leads to the last instances are notable, but as the sentence was predetermined, the court is a sordid masquerade. Douglas begins to be cordial and contained, an officer at the orders, part of the gear, but gradually changes as his character is confronted with all that brutality, and this is really a meritorious effort for any actor. I don't know his work well yet, but I wouldn't surprise me if this was one of Douglas's best movies. Unfortunately, and without disregard for Adolphe Menjou and Joe Turkel's efforts, the rest of the cast does not accompany him at all.""]"

While of course there’s the small matter of the escape attempt that’s planned, will they be able to trust the newcomer? Will he join in and help? Pertinent questions hang heavy in the sweaty air. \r\n\r\nOnce Claude Gaspard (Michel) arrives in the cell, the narrative initially operates on a cat and mouse basis as the men sound out the newcomer. There’s no histrionics, no threats of violence, an enforcement of machismo to intimidate the new cellmate, just human interaction with viable concerns. Much of these passages pulse with atmosphere as the men talk in hushed tones, or just exchange glances, and then once an accord is reached, all parties are comfortable with each other, it’s time to put the escape plan into action. \r\n\r\nWhat follows is quite simply engrossing suspense as Becker deals in long takes of silence punctuated by animal strength as the men pound on concrete with metal. The camera stays static, filming as if in real time, the sound department ramp up the volume to splinter the ears. We observe as the men fashion devices to aid their escape and to remain undetected, some of it genius in its simplicity. And all the while there is the feeling of trust, a bond between the incarcerated males, where the two lead off men are entrusted to go out and beyond the bowels of the prison, working tirelessly in charting the course through a maze of murky masonry, and to then return back to “HQ” for some rest and updates of the progress… \r\n\r\nThe use of non professional actors works brilliantly, adding further realism to the story, with one of them, Jean Keraudy, a bona fide prisoner from the actual event back in 1947. There’s no music here, it isn’t needed to emphasise or manipulate a scene, none more so with the denouement, a closure of some emotional magnitude, and once again it’s without histrionics, and once again it works brilliantly. 9/10', ""This week's Noir of the Week is Le Trou (1960) directed by Jacques Becker. The film was called The Night Watch when released in the US in 1960.\r\n\r\nThe 2 ½ hour prison escape film, like Rififi, utilizes long, unbroken, often dialogue-free shots to dramatize the simple story of a group of prisoners attempting an ambitious escape from prison. Le Trou is shot in black and white and is totally without soundtrack music until the very end.\r\n\r\nThe film begins with one of the escapees, now outside the Santé Prison walls introducing the story. The film then flashes back to the Paris prison in 1947.\r\n\r\nWe’re then introduced to a young man Claude Gaspard. He’s put into a very small cell with four other inmates. There he meets the charming, always smiling Volsselin, nicknamed Monseigneur. Also in the cell are fellow inmates Roland Darbant, the man who introduced the film, Geo Cassid, and Manu Borelli.\r\n\r\nThe men work in their cell assembling cardboard boxes. Gaspard finds out that the men in his cell all eat well from care packages from the outside and all are close friends. What he doesn’t realize is that the men are working on escaping. While picking up a care package filled with bread, butter, saugage, smoked fish and rice pudding, the men discuss whether the should tell the new guy about their prison escape plans. They eventually take Gaspard into their confidence and being the long task of breaking the floor.\r\n\r\nSlowly, in real time, the men chip away at the concrete floor that leads to a sewer tunnel.\r\n\r\nThe film lacks most prison film clichés. There are no sadistic prison guards, and all the prisoners seem like regular guys. Director Becker, who died shortly after the film was completed, used unprofessional actors including Jean Keraudy who was an actual participant in the escape attempt in 1947.\r\n\r\nGiven the film takes place in only three days, the sense of overwhelming tenacity shown by the prisoners is an astounding piece of filmmaking. The film has a number of memorable scenes, including the noisy breaking of the concrete floor with one of the bed legs –in real time- while another prisoner looks out the peep hole using a spy glass made from a tooth brush and a broken piece of mirror. Watching the scene draws you in an even makes you feel like a participant in the hacking, sawing and picking.\r\n\r\nI won’t give away the ending or any of the interesting plot twists, but let’s just say there’s a heart-breaking double cross involved in a very un-Hollywood finish. Young Gaspard has to bear the brunt of an ironic plot-twist at the end. The film is a great prison escape film not to be mistaken for the French New Wave happening at the same time.\r\n\r\nWritten by Steve-O""]"

OldBoy here, second installment from The Vengeance Trilogy directed by  Park Chan-wook (Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance, OldBoy, Sympathy for Lady Vengeance) really have them all, good story, powerful acting and the most horrifying and clever end twist if not genius. In fact no matter how many times you see this, the twist would still be awesome. The theme of revenge here is taken to the next level, to its supremacy for it’s really carefully-planned. OldBoy has a mind-bending assortment of drama, thriller, romance and beautifully spiced up with sadistic plot, shocking elements, ultra violence and clever psychological twist. Imagine yourself captured, locked in a room for 15 years, not knowing why and who did it and when you finally escaped and thought it’s all over, you were wrong and here’s the punching line, the direct punch to your stomach. Min-sik Choi as Oh Dae su really acted well, he really got us carried away by dragging us into the mystery that surrounds his life, into the depression he’s been feeling and into the deep well of his curiosity. Once again, OldBoy is a way too remarkable, when “revenge” isn’t merely knife-chopping or gun-battling. Enough said.', ""This is definitely one of the films to see before you die. It's seat-squirmingly unsettling, shocking and very violent. \r\n\r\nIt's a journey into a truly disturbed mind; a mind, which - like yours will be - is unable to cope with what it discovers.\r\n\r\nThis film is brilliantly twisted. It has a thread of the most wonderful, blackest humour running through it, a sense of complete disorientation and enough plot twists and turns to sustain your interest.\r\n\r\nNot one of the best revenge thrillers I've seen - simply THE best!"", 'Just about everyone I’d spoken to about this film recommended it to me.\r\n\r\nI watched this film with the original Korean-language soundtrack, with English subtitles.\r\n\r\nOh Dae-su (Chi Min-sik) is a bit of a flirt (whether he is a womaniser is not made clear) with a wife and young child, who has turned two years old on the day we start the film. Dae-su is in a prison waiting room having insulted a woman he was flirting with. A friend comes and eventually gets him out, but while he’s making a call to his wife to explain he will be home soon, he is kidnapped.\r\n\r\nIncarcerated in a small room, with only a TV for company, he is fed and looked after, but not allowed his freedom. He unsuccessfully attempts suicide several times. He keeps himself fit by doing exercise programmes he sees on TV and he starts to dig his way out with chopsticks. He sees a TV report that shows he’s been framed for the murder of his wife. Fifteen years later, without a word of explanation, he is released.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the film follows his attempts to find out why he was imprisoned, who did it, and where his daughter is.\r\n\r\nThe film is frenetic, highly charged, and very emotional on several levels. It is also bloody in places, but Dae-su’s obsession for seeking revenge on whomsoever imprisoned him and on finding out where his daughter is drives this film along. There are psychological aspects to the film as well, and the film does eventually resolve itself – it is not one of those open-ended “I wonder who did it” type films. Follow the film through and you will get all the answers.\r\n\r\nI would recommend it, but I wouldn’t call it light entertainment.']"

It\'s bleak, grim and repulsive - and all in a great, intentional, cinematographic fashion. The thread centres around the young ""Flyora"" (a superb effort from Aleksey Kravchenko) who is taken from his Belorussian family farm at gunpoint (along with anything it\'s possible to eat) by the invading Nazi troops. What now ensues follows this young man as he escapes his captors, finds an old rifle and determines to join up with the communists who are fighting almost insurmountable odds to thwart their encroaching, heavily armed, foe. What really resonates here is the simplicity of the production. There are no specials effects, no CGI to create many when there are few - it tells the simplest of stories in a manner that is truly brutal at times, then truly evocative at others. Man\'s inhumanity to man and all that - but writ large and depicting an invading army devoid of any semblance of humanity on just about every level. The experiences of this young man are truly horrific, but the presentation here is not especially graphic - though it\'s not for the faint hearted. We are shown what is happening, but Elem Klimov leaves plenty of scope for our own imagination to augment, if that is actually possible, the true grotesqueness of war, of random killings and destruction and all quite possibly exacerbated by the fact that the conquerors had no real idea what they were doing, or why - the film almost imbues them with the characteristics of the wildest of animals who enjoy their regime of torture and malevolence for the sake of it. The ending has a certain degree of vindication about it - but oddly enough it\'s not especially satisfying. The emotional exhaustion of the viewer has long since set in, and the true fate of what I can only really call these uniformed bullies is just, yet somehow inadequate. The film is gently paced, it could almost be a video diary as young ""Flyora"" meets and hides from those he encounters and we share his fears and risks en route. This is really well worth a watch but it\'s not an easy one.']"

I mean, who hasn’t seen this movie yet? If by some extraordinary circumstances you’re one of those unlucky souls, stop. Spend the next hour and a half watching this animated masterpiece and come back here. I will still avoid mentioning key details because I’m just used to it, and The Lion King has so many things to compliment that I don’t really need to get in-depth on spoilers. So, in case you haven’t notice it through my Twitter or occasional mentions in other reviews, The Lion King is one of my favorite films of all-time (animated or not)!\r\n\r\nI rewatched it for the 312358th time this last weekend, and I cried more than when I was just a child. That’s how much this movie means to me. The sense of nostalgia plus the overwhelming emotions throughout the runtime are tear-inducing aspects that I can’t simply avoid. I literally cried (waterfalls) in four (!) different scenes. The opening sequence (Circle of Life) filled my eyes with nostalgia’s tears. Mufasa’s tragic moment obviously wrecked me (one of the most emotionally powerful scenes in the history of cinema). Simba receiving the whole “remember who you are” speech from Mufasa in the clouds is incredibly inspirational and therefore worthy of some sobbing. Finally, one of the last scenes, Simba climbing his way to the top of Pride Rock with Hans Zimmer‘s score, leaving me absolutely destroyed.\r\n\r\nAnd I want to pick up on that last aspect: the score. It’s one of the most crucial technical features of a film, in my opinion. It can transform an “okay” scene into something magical or something pretty terrible, depending on what kind of score it is. Consequently, it can make a “good” movie turn into a “great” one. Hans Zimmer is one of my favorite composers ever. His soundtracks are always filled with such an epic vibe. Even if the film itself isn’t that good, his scores are still able to elevate it in some way. The Lion King is one of his most memorable scores due to how emotionally compelling it is, even in the subtlest moments.\r\n\r\nDuring the stampede sequence, the score doesn’t lend you time to breathe. Its high rhythm and continuously growing music keep any viewer at the edge of the seat, waiting for it to be over. Then, when Simba descends and approaches his dad, the score is so subtle. Completely opposite to the previous sumptuous and grand sound. It’s that nuance plus the impact of the scene itself that make me cry. In the last scene that I mentioned above, it’s solely the score that brings in the chill-inducing tears. If Simba climbed Pride Rock with no soundtrack, it would just be a good ending. However, from the exact moment that the score fades in, it instantly turns that sequence into an epic finale. The slow-motion walk to the top, the immersive score, Simba’s roar … Damn it, I’m crying again!\r\n\r\nThe animation is some of Disney’s best. It’s not by chance that the Disney Renaissance Era (1989-1999), which was the return to form by Disney, has the best animation quality of its history, and a lot of the memorable movies that marked everyone’s childhood. Its expressiveness and ease to make animals emote elevates the story and its characters. There’s no need for any kind of dialogue when you can see how the characters are reacting and understand what they’re feeling. The wide shots are beautiful to look at and worthy of being anyone’s wallpaper even today.\r\n\r\nThe songs are remarkable and they influenced an entire generation. Can You Feel the Love Tonight, Circle of Life, Be Prepared, Hakuna Matata, … Every single song is someone’s favorite. The voice work is perfect. James Earl Jones gives such an outstanding vocal performance that even when discussing his career’s biggest role, Darth Vader isn’t the obvious choice. Jeremy Irons and his raspy voice elevate Scar as the villainous character. If you close your eyes and only hear every character’s voice, without having watched the film previously, you can easily identify who’s the “bad guy”, and that’s unbelievably good. Everyone else is amazing, but these two gentlemen are astonishing, and they deserve to be remembered forever as the voices of these iconic roles.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in the end, the two pillars of every movie always matter the most: story and characters. The Lion King has an especially compelling screenplay, one that teaches its viewers how to handle loss, but also how to grow up and overcome our worst fears. It’s true that most people cry watching this film, but those same people are filled with joy by the end because they accompanied Simba’s journey. From being a reckless and innocent cub to becoming the king that everyone needed, while also making his father extremely proud. Even though it’s a very tragic movie, Timon and Pumbaa are two hilarious characters that keep bringing some sense of happiness by delivering some well-needed laughs. Their laid-back lifestyle is something that everyone desires, but when you have responsibilities, you can’t just hide from them. You must learn how to be what everyone needs you to be, without losing the essence of who you are.\r\n\r\nIt’s a masterpiece! It doesn’t matter if it’s an animated film. It doesn’t matter if it was “made for kids”. People need to stop looking at animated flicks as something juvenile that only children can watch while parents can do something else. If parents watched this kind of inspirational animated movies as well, maybe the world would be a better place. The Lion King is one of my favorite films of all-time, and it’s undeniably one of Disney’s best original movies. From the gorgeous animation to the beautiful score, from the emotionally compelling story to the life journey Simba goes through, from the chill-inducing tearful moments to the loud laughs … The Lion King is just perfect. Hopefully, its “live-action” remake will keep its essence and deliver these feelings once again.\r\n\r\nRating: A+', 'Certainly not one of Disney\'s better animations from a technical perspective - the artwork lacks the vibrancy and detail of many of their earlier stories; but the combined efforts of Sir Tim Rice, Elton John and Hans Zimmer make this an enjoyable fantasy adventure. It is told in two parts - the first sees a son ""Simba"" born to the king ""Mufasa""; a curious little fella who, alongside his friend ""Nala"" is inquisitive and mischievous - a real pain in the neck to the king\'s major-domo ""Zazu"". One fan the new cub really doesn\'t have, however, is the king\'s rather unimpressed brother ""Scar"" who hatches a plan to depose his brother and take over the kingdom. He manages to achieve exactly this and to get the youngster to blame himself and head off, alone, into exile. The second part is much more fun; he falls in with a warthog and is soon eating colourful grubs and living a peaceful, jolly life far from home. That idyllic existence is not to last long, however - ""Nala"" discovers he is still alive and races to alert him of the disaster that has befallen the kingdom under the rule of his uncle and his trusty band of hyenas. The musical numbers help it build to a gripping denouement, with clever, quite witty dialogue from some good - though not great - voice talents from the likes of James Earl Jones, Jeremy Irons, Nathan Lane, Matthew Broderick and Whoopi Goldberg to keep the pot boiling. It is an enjoyable film to watch but I wasn\'t captivated by it.']"

Last year’s “Avengers: Infinity War” set the stage for the highly-anticipated conclusion; “Avengers: End Game” and at long last it has arrived.\r\n\r\nPicking up shortly after the events of the last film, the Avengers must deal with the aftermath of what Thanos has done. The team is naturally divided between wanting revenge, wanting to set things right, and just wanting to take what they have and go on. \r\n\r\nAs time passes and they struggle to accept the reality of their situation; an unexpected individual returns and with them comes the seeds of a new plan to make things right. Naturally Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is skeptical but eventually warms to the possibilities of the idea thanks to a new scientific breakthrough that makes it possible.\r\n\r\nInspired, Tony sets out to put an elaborate plan in motion that will allow the team to try to fix things and to stop Thanos once and for all.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is an extended and at times nostalgic heist where various members of the team work to assemble the pieces needed for the plan as they believe they only have one chance to make things right.\r\n\r\nThe film is essentially three acts in one. The first deals with the recap and expansion of their situation and the planning. The second act is basically a heist where action and comedy are blended with some touching moments.\r\n\r\nThis all leads to the final act which is the FX laden set piece where the ensemble cast gathers to fight the forces of evil in a battle to save the Universe.\r\nThe film is epic in scale and length as it clocks in at over three hours but the movie is filled with so much content that the time goes by quickly and you have a hard time believing three hours have elapsed.\r\n\r\nIt is also a difficult film to review as you cannot recap elements of the film in any great detail without giving away elements that are sure to delight the fans. Suffice it to say that my only real issue with the fil and it was minor; was that it took a while to get to the action but at least there was plenty to keep you entertained along the way.\r\n\r\nAs this phase of the Marvel Film Universe winds down and plans are put in place for the next five years; “Avengers: End Game” is a satisfying conclusion to the epic saga that was started many years ago and weaves elements of many of the past Marvel films into an entertaining tale which features all of the best elements that have made the series of films such big hits.\r\n\r\n4.5 stars out of 5', ""Hey, so, just some really quick thoughts I wanna get down, 'cause it's after 1 o'clock in the morning, and I wanna get some sleep so I can wake up well rested to see _Endgame_ again.\r\n\r\nPutting it out there right from the get-go, _Avengers: Endgame_ is my favourite MCU movie. It's my favourite movie of the year too, but I've only seen like ten or so 2019 releases, and this is the 22nd Marvel Cinematic Universe film, so that seems far and away the bigger deal. I can't say it's perfect, there's some conflicting stuff within its own runtime that really doesn't seem to gel (though a re-watch may prove me wrong on that), and it's not like every moment was the no-holds-barred-zero-exception best version of that moment from start to end. But God I loved this thing.\r\n\r\nI will say this though, the reason that I loved it, is this thing is fan service galore. If you do not care for the franchise's 21 movies preceding this point, then _Endgame_ is not the movie to turn you around on that. That may come in a future installment, but this one is a culmination. It's the end of _Infinity War_ but also Phase 3, but also a wrap-up and genuine ode to/send off for everything that Marvel has done over the past 11 years. That to me was incredible, and I am eternally greatful, but I cannot imagine it working for people who have no vested interest in these characters.\r\n\r\nTo me though? My first 9 out of 10 rating in **three years**.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:★★★★½ - Ridiculously strong appeal. I can’t stop thinking about it._"", 'If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nDon\'t worry. This is going to be a pretty vague review. Right now, as I\'m writing this sentence, I\'m still processing what I saw and how am I going to explain how I felt without spoiling a single tiny thing. First of all, it\'s such a mix of feelings. On one hand, I\'m extremely happy that I was lucky to be alive during this epic time and that I was able to follow these characters that I love and care about so much. On the other hand, I\'m obviously sad that it finally reached the end of this (hopefully) first incredible saga. There are no perfect films and one with so many heroes will always have struggles balancing it all (Infinity War already had this issue). \r\n\r\nHowever, the Russo brothers did everything they could to deliver a phenomenal story, and they did. I don\'t think this could have been any better. Its last hour exceeds any expectations. It\'s epic, emotional, action-heavy, and it has one of my favorite shots in the entire history of cinema. It\'s pure magic, and the VFX team will surely get an Oscar for it. The action reminded me of the biggest Lord of the Rings\' battles, and it was impeccably filmed, filled with riveting and chill-inducing sequences. Nevertheless, don\'t expect this high-intensity feeling throughout the whole runtime. The other two acts are a slow-burn build-up to a payoff that\'s going to make you pretty much either ""love"" or ""like"" this movie. I absolutely love it! \r\n\r\nThis is easily one of the best MCU films, if not my new number one. I can\'t deny that the 3-hour runtime has some unnecessary scenes, but even if they don\'t have a significant impact on the plot or even in the characters, they still contribute to the enormous build-up. Seeing this family that we grew up with just talking with each other or having lunch, at the same time that they deal with the consequences of Thanos\' snap, is inexplicably captivating and heartwarming. Characters like Natasha (Scarlett Johansson) and Steve (Chris Evans) supporting each other is simply beautiful. Their comradery and chemistry are worthy of some tears here and there.\r\n\r\nSome people didn\'t really enjoy Infinity War so much due to the lack of screentime that some characters had. This time around, there are fewer characters to work with, so the balance is better. Everyone gets an important role, from Captain America to Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) to Nebula (Karen Gillan), and even Rocket (Bradley Cooper). Every single character has a major moment. If you take one out of the movie, it just doesn\'t work anymore. This is not only great work from the directors, but also from the writers. \r\n\r\nChristopher Markus and Stephen McFeely are not even going to be remembered because fans will always think of the cast first. Most of them will also remember the directors. But the writers?! If I stand at the door of the theater at the end of the film and question everyone about who are the writers, I strongly believe most of the audience won\'t know. Every dialogue, every sentence, every word carries so much impact on the narrative. Literally, I cried and got chills just by hearing two freaking words with the perfect timing in between. The amount of grief that the words of the ones who\'ve lost everyone and everything carry is palpable and, for me, those are the most emotional moments of the movie: seeing how everyone is suffering from their own losses, not the deaths themselves.\r\n\r\nThe humor is mostly on-point, but it\'s still connected to my only real issue with the film, which is the second act\'s tone. From the moment the team decides what to do, we already know that this is a 1 in 14 million chance of success like Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) said, so the stakes and pressure are massive! With this level of tension, I didn\'t expect such an “easygoing” and “funny” vibe throughout, except for one particular sequence. They do a great job once again of pairing up certain Avengers together, but most of them go through these too comedic plot points for such a crucial and serious mission. Fortunately, this act carries enough action and emotional drive to make this problem not that big of an issue.\r\n\r\nVisually, this is arguably the best-looking superhero film ever. From the mind-blowing visual effects to the gorgeous cinematography, everything is perfect. The costumes are gritty and muddy when our heroes are in a battle, their faces are all filled with blood, and I have no words to describe how jaw-dropping that last act is. I can\'t wait to change my desktop wallpaper once THAT shot is available. I dropped a single tear just by looking at it. No one talks, no one does anything. It\'s just an amazingly beautiful image. The score is epic as hell. So much that I\'m listening to it right now as I\'m writing this review, and I\'m getting chills all over my body. \r\n\r\nI can\'t really write much more, to be honest. I will acknowledge the cast because they are brilliant. Each and every single member delivers an outstanding performance, but if I had to choose the ones that both surprised me and had the most impact on me, they would be Johansson\'s, Evans\', and Robert Downey Jr\'s (Tony Stark / Iron Man). “New” characters like Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) blend seamlessly, and the payoff is unbelievably satisfying. In terms of predictability, it goes more or less as I expected, but it still carries a few surprises throughout. Nothing is ever like we imagine or theorize about, so expect the unexpected, and don\'t judge a movie by if it fits your crazy, unrealistic theories that never crossed the producers and directors\' minds in the first place!\r\n\r\nAll in all, I don\'t know what to do now. The only thing I\'m sure of is that I want to see it again, as soon as possible. The last hour is f*cking insane. I couldn\'t fall asleep properly because I couldn\'t stop thinking about it. Endgame surpasses all expectations. It\'s everything I wished for and so much more. I could easily spend a whole day at the movie theater and watch three sessions in a row. It\'s that good. One of the best comic-book films of all-time, without a single doubt. Thank you to Kevin Feige and everyone who worked hard to bring the MCU to where it stands now. I can\'t even think of how are they going to produce something at the level of Infinity Saga. Maybe they never will. Maybe we\'ll have to wait another decade or two for something like this. Until then, see you at the next Endgame screening! Enjoy! Oh and #DontSpoilTheEndgame!\r\n\r\nPS: it\'s not a perfect movie, I know. It doesn\'t exist one. Yes, Endgame has some issues regarding its pacing and tone, but I would be lying to myself if this isn\'t everything I dreamed of. I felt the same way with Civil War, regarding the rating to give, and I ended up giving it an A after a first viewing. As soon as I watched the second time, I changed it to an A+. I don’t need to wait for that second viewing with Endgame … And thank you to my audience for being incredibly respectful. No yelling, no crazy laughs, no stupid people doing stupid stuff. Thank you so much for not ruining one of the best cinematic experiences of my life!\r\n\r\nRating: A+', ""okay so if your like me you questioned this movie due to the fact that i personally thought nothing could beat infinity war well after seeing it i can honestly say we have a new champion this was absolutley excelent so hilarious action packed the 3 hrs passes extremily fast my only thing is the use of god.... bothered me and i suggest if your offended by that wait till dvd so you can mute the parts also a reminder to parents 'no matter how bad you want to see the movie dont do like people in my theater did and bring your 3 year old 'but besides that awesome movie"", 'We waited till day 5 of release in theaters. There was a slow start to the movie so i don\'t recommend taking little ones under the age of 10. After all the anticipation and hype,Avengers Endgame did not disappoint. Waa a perfect ""ending\' to the series. Very well done', 'These kind of movies are among the few movies that I can be bothered to go to an actual theater to watch nowadays. For most movies I just wait until they come out on disk (preferably Ultra HD Blu-ray if it’s available) and watch them on my home theater rig. So this weekend me and the kids went to the theater to watch Avengers: Endgame.\r\n\r\nI have to say that it was better, even much better, than I feared. I really feared that the SJW retards at Marvel would take this opportunity to completely re-organize the Marvel universe to their liking. Like how they completely ruined both professor Xavier and Wolverine in that abysmal Logan movie. Luckily, this did not really happen. Maybe the financial reality of their failing SJW comics and Disney doing a bit of culling of the most extreme of the Marvel retards, the ones who fail to understand that super hero movies are meant to entertain and not be their personal agenda channel, are starting to take effect.\r\n\r\nIt was actually a quite good movie with plenty of action, some humor and, of course, lots and lots of special effects. Even the story made somewhat sense, at least in the context of a Marvel movie, even though the writers resorted to time travel.\r\n\r\nThe movie starts of somewhat dark and grim but I guess that was to be suspected. It cheered up as it moved along and then ending … well to me at least it was mostly satisfactory.\r\n\r\nI was not too thrilled about the “new” Hulk although I warmed up to him a bit during the film. Thor? The less that is said about him the better actually. The rest of the merry bunch was in pretty good shape and I am quite happy that we did not get to see to much of Quill’s usual shenanigans. I really hate that character.\r\n\r\nI was quite positively surprised at the huge and quite cool battle towards the end. I was thinking, or rather hoping,  that at some time they were just going to reverse Thanos’ crap and that would be it but instead we get to watch another huge confrontation with pretty much everyone involved at the end. Very cool action and FX indeed.\r\n\r\nThere were some silly plot holes of course. As always when writers resort to time travel. An obvious one would of course be that, when they knew they only had enough Pym particles to complete one trip for each person why did they just not go back in time to get more the first thing they did? Especially since they later did exactly that. Also, Captain Marvel (in her new SJW hairdo) flies through a barrage of fire, smashes through Thanos’ ship like it was nothing and then struggles to combat Thanos himself? There were a bit of this silliness spread around but not too much for me to be bothered by it.\r\n\r\nThere were a few casualties of which I am saddened by two of them. I think at least one of them was unnecessary and probably agenda based. I also strongly disliked the rubbish with Captain America at the end. He has never been one of my favorite characters so I do not really care much about him being around or not but that rubbish sob-scene where he hands over his shield to a “politically correct” person was really unnecessary. I guess it must have been put there to appease the Marvel SJW retards.\r\n\r\nAnyway, my bottom line is that I was greatly entertained by this movie. It had all the good stuff, real super heroes, action, special effects and not too much of the crap that has been spewing out of Marvel the last years.', 'Awesome!', '***How can they possibly save half of all living beings in the Universe?***\r\n\r\nHow are the surviving Avengers & Co. possibly going to save half of the Universe that died? My wife & I had this discussion before viewing. It basically comes down to two options (assuming the events in ""Infinity War"" weren’t just a dream): magic or time travel. All I’ll say is: What they came up with was in ways reminiscent of the plot convolutions of ""Back to the Future II"" (1989).\r\n\r\n“Endgame” (2019) begins strong with the devastating reality of half of all living beings in the Universe suddenly vanishing. It starts to get lethargic about an hour in, but perks up with the three teams trying to apprehend the Infinity Stones so they can maybe reverse what happened at the end of the previous film.\r\n\r\nEverything naturally leads to a huge battle in the last hour that I found boring, not to mention that the epilogue tended to drag on with too much of it being tedious. Still, there are lots of worthy bits throughout, like the opening, the unpredictable first encounter with Thanos, Thor getting flabby, the moving match between Black Widow and Hawkeye at the cliff’s edge, and much more. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the myriad protagonists work against the film because it can’t concentrate on any one or two characters for very long. Captain Marvel is short shifted and decidedly dull. Plus the movie’s overlong at 3 hours, 1 minute.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B/B-', 'The amazing fight scenes and CGI aren’t enough to mask the fact that the overall plot of going back in time to change reality is just plain stupid and lazy - and this is addressed to the writers.

Would personally recommend you give it a go._"", 'If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)\r\n\r\nLiving in Portugal has a ton of pros, but regarding movies, it lacks serious advantages. The price of admission is expensive, there is only one film theater in my city (every time I want to watch a movie on IMAX or Dolby Atmos, it\'s a financial effort and time-consuming) and the worst of all, a whole bunch of films aren\'t released in their original date, especially November/December Oscar-bait movies. Only now I had the opportunity to see Green Book, and I am so mad I wasn\'t able to write its review in 2018 because this is undoubtedly the best comedy-drama of last year and one of the best overall!\r\n\r\nWith the help of a terrific cast, Peter Farrelly and his writing crew (which counts with Vallelonga\'s son, Nick) deliver what I think is the best screenplay of 2018. I can\'t remember the last time I cried of so much laughter in a film. I can\'t remember the last time I did the latter and still got emotional with the dramatic arc. This comedy-drama sent me through a roller coaster of emotions I wasn\'t expecting, at all. I went in anticipating outstanding performances (check) and solely that. Since 2019 has already begun, I\'m watching the Oscar-bait movies with no real hopes of being utterly amazed.\r\n\r\nHowever, Green Book completely took me by surprise. I genuinely don\'t know why everyone was so shocked when it won Best Screenplay at the Golden Globe Awards. It possesses such a well-written story, filled with brilliant narratives about the most sensitive subjects. It takes the two main characters and elevates their individual arcs into subplots where you begin and end with two completely different personas. It\'s an extremely relevant film that shows how our world evolved and fought back racism and discrimination, without ever becoming too dark or even dull. It\'s not more of the same, it\'s not another movie produced exclusively to send a social message and catch some Oscar nominations. It\'s a truly captivating story of how two men can change their perspective of another race or even the entire world, by actually spending time with another culture and ignoring preconceived notions.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, this well-structured, beautifully-directed and cleverly-written film would be just ""good"" if not for the two incredible actors, who take this movie to a whole other level. Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali have such compelling chemistry that I wouldn\'t mind watching them interact for two hours on a car trip. Every single car sequence either produces hilarious moments, filled with tearful laughter, or it drastically changes into a more dramatic and emotional tone, subtly touching delicate topics. I knew Mortensen had a humorous side to him, but I never saw this coming! His timing, his expressions, his Italian accent, his body movements, everything about his performance is perfect. He absolutely nailed his part, by giving me the best time I had at a film theater in a long time, and his Oscar nomination is more than fair. He made a 130-min feature movie feel like a short flick.\r\n\r\nAli doesn\'t come far behind. Obviously, since Viggo has a funnier role to portray, the audience members might feel that he\'s just there to help his co-star shine, but he does much more than that. Since he brings the drama element to the story, he has a more restrained performance during the first half of the film. However, once Shirley starts getting along with Tony Lip, Ali gradually offers more and more splendid acting moments. He\'s definitely a supporting actor, but God is he a phenomenal one! Linda Cardellini (Dolores Vallelonga), even though she\'s only on-screen for a few minutes spread throughout the runtime, also delivers a great performance.\r\n\r\nTony Lip and Dr. Don Shirley have quite distinct personalities, besides being from different races. Each character\'s arc is brilliantly illustrated by Peter Farrelly, who gradually shows how Tony and Don are changing their view of the world and of each other\'s culture. Either through the witty car sequences or through unfortunate and horrible experiences, these two characters carry the audience on a journey of growth. Change in behavior, mindset and preconceived ideas, by sharing their own culture with another. Even though they were born in different countries and lived through distinguished lifestyles, with contrasting quality of life, they eventually start realizing that what they think of the world and everything else might not be entirely right.\r\n\r\nTechnically, Farrelly controls the movie\'s pacing exceptionally well, by making a two-hour-ish film feel like half of it. Remarkably-balanced tone and some great cinematography is showed in a couple of scenes. Consistently-filmed and well-edited, even though the latter has small hiccups here and there. Nevertheless, this isn\'t a film with extraordinary technical attributes, nor it needs them. Farrelly only needed to do ""ok"" with the producing and filming of a standout screenplay to achieve a fantastic result, and that\'s exactly what he did.\r\n\r\nFinally, regarding the controversy surrounding this movie ... See how easy it is to watch a film without being affected by outside matters which don\'t have a single thing to do with the movie itself? I don\'t care if someone who worked in the film tweeted something wrong today, let alone years ago. I don\'t care if someone misinterprets Viggo Mortensen\'s speech about racism. I don\'t care if the family of Don Shirley doesn\'t like how the movie approaches his way of being or his way of life. I don\'t care if the story isn\'t 100% true, as long as it succeeds in transmitting the vital message it wants to deliver, while actually being a good film. So, please, stop trying to listen to everything everyone says about a movie or the people working on it, especially nowadays, where chaos is easy to create.\r\n\r\nGreen Book surprised the hell out of me and left me speechless in the end. One of the best comedy-dramas I\'ve seen in a long time, one of the best films of 2017 and, by far, the best original screenplay of the last year. Peter Farrelly and his fellow co-writers delivered a seamlessly-written story, filled with wonderful character arcs and with a quite important message to the audiences around the world. Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali deliver award-worthy performances, especially the former who shows his incredible comedic timing and dramatic range. Still, the most compelling and emotional scenes come from Ali, and he does not deserve to be forgotten. I thought 2018 was going to be the first year without me giving an A+, but guess what ...\r\n\r\nRating: A+', '""Frequently, when someone tries to portray the overwhelming decade of the 1960s, they usually misuse the concept of discrimination towards African Americans, which is accurate to describe this social issue. Nevertheless, the way Peter Farrelly and staff go into detail about this social wretchedness embodying the psychological impact it has in the main character makes the film an outstanding one"".\r\n\r\nThe year is 1962, and the film begins inside Copacabana restaurant where we get introduced the imposing personality of Tony Lip, an Italian descendant whose family came from a lower middle class coping with some financial difficulties. The way Viggo Mortensen performs the character is a proper model of then American racism; therefore he attempted to keep them out until the occasion arrived and Don Shirley appeared in his path, offering him a two-month lifetime opportunity. We all need to bear in mind the precise dates because, in real life, it was nearly a year they spent together. Despite his gifted pianist skills and his upper-class status, he was still a victim of the convulsed cultural impact. Both of them, during the film, learn from each other and fight against the unsettling behaviour of determined people. \r\n\r\nAlthough it may seem simple, their interaction is one of the primary reasons why it succeeds. Believe it or not, it arouses curiosity, reaches the climax when they finally let them know as they are, and sometimes it results as a plot twister due to the radical temperament change of each actor. It has been ages since I watched such a pleasant film; afterwards, I felt refreshed as though it renewed me.\r\n\r\nThe contextualisation was imperative to build up each one\'s personality; moreover, it was visually dazzling owing to the costumes, the space and the background advertisement of the decade. Comedy is present as well so that you won\'t be missing from genuine laughs. Everything appears to be perfectly balanced, even the role of secondary personages such as Tony\'s wife and the cheeky cards experience. I\'m chuffed to bits!\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the film ""Green Book"" is an exceptional example of the conception of a masterpiece without spending loads of money in production and without creating plenty of trifling scenarios.\r\n\r\n\r\n[85/100]', '***A white streetwise bouncer and an articulate black pianist tour the Deep South in 1962***\r\n\r\nA tough, working class Italian New Yawker (Viggo Mortensen) is forced to take a gig driving a refined African-American concert pianist (Mahershala Ali) through the Midwest and Deep South in 1962. Linda Cardellini plays the wife of the Italian.             \r\n\r\n“Green Book” (2018) was inspired by the real-life story and written by the son of Tony Lip (Mortensen). Like all great dramas, it’s compelling from the get-go and the road movie approach provides an entertaining and revelatory string of episodes, not to mention occasionally amusing. While the movie’s been accused of reverse racism, it’s actually balanced, showing plenty of poor, inarticulate blacks and vice versa. The message is to base your perceptions on the individual rather than ignorant generalizations.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hours, 10 minutes, and was shot in New York City and Louisiana.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A', 'This movie has a weak understanding of not only the truth in the relationship between the two characters based on actual people, but simplifies the subject of race relations. It was a terrible choice for best picture.', 'After a superb opening scene we get a heartwarming feel-good film that plays it a little too safe, but the chemistry between the two leads and some humor make ‘Green Book’ funny and highly enjoyable.\r\n\r\n8/10', ""I guess that this made it to the Academy Awards for saying something that has been said a thousand times before. But because it was made in 2018 and everyone below 30 and everyone in Hollywood pretends that cinema didn't exist until 2016 it had high praise.\r\n\r\nThe acting is not bad, but for a movie set in the South, it could have used to actually show some of the beauty of the region they were driving through. Independent films have done a better job than this.\r\n\r\nBut, because of the message, because of the statement we have heard a thousand times before, I guess you are supposed to love this and treat it like it's new.\r\n\r\nIt's not, the 70s and 80s had a lot of movies like this and they carried over into the 90s.""]"

Thanos has appeared in several other MCU films, but he seemed rather flat in those movies. Here, he's allowed to be fully developed as a character. Especially touching is his relationship with his adoptive daughter, Gamora. It's actually surprisingly tender and moving. Thanos is the actual main focus of the film, and if he failed as a character, the entire movie wouldn't have worked. So bravo, Marvel!"", 'Best Movie Ever...', '***Moving ending, but the least of the Avengers movies IMHO***\r\n\r\nRELEASED IN 2018 and directed by Anthony & Joe Russo, ""Avengers: Infinity War"" chronicles events when the Avengers team-up with several allies to defeat the cosmic despot Thanos, whose goal is to collect all six Infinity Stones to attain unimaginable power and radically solve one of the Universe\'s most challenging problems.\r\n\r\nThe story focuses on Thanos, Thor and the Guardians of the Galaxy, especially Gamora, as well as Iron Man, Doctor Strange and Spider-Man. The rest of the cast members are more peripheral, e.g. Black Widow, Captain America, Black Panther, Vision and Scarlet Witch.\r\n\r\nThis is easily the least of the Avengers trilogy. Not to mention ""Captain America: Civil War"" (2016) and ""Thor: Ragnarok"" (2017) are significantly more compelling and all-around entertaining. Actually, all three Thor flicks are palpably superior, as is ""Iron Man 2"" (2010). If you haven\'t already, I encourage you to watch these movies prior to viewing ""Infinity War,"" as well as ""Black Panther"" (2018) and the two ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" flicks (2014/2017); otherwise you\'ll likely be lost because all these movies lead up to this one.\r\n\r\n""Infinity War"" is certainly an ambitious comic book movie in that it notably juggles so many super-beings, but this lack of focus isn\'t conducive to suspense or great drama.

Reality itself is a ravaged dystopia run by technocrat Artificial Intelligence where humankind vegetates in billions of gloop-filled tanks - mere battery packs for the machineworld - being fed this late \'90s VR (known as The Matrix - you with us here?) through an ugly great cable stuck in the back of our heads. And what if there was a group of quasi-spiritual rebels infiltrating The Matrix with the sole purpose of crashing the ruddy great mainframe and rescuing humans from their unknown purgatory? And, hey, what if Keanu Reeves was their Messiah?\r\n\r\nWhat sounds like some web freak\'s wet dream is, in fact, a dazzlingly nifty slice of sci-fi cool. The Wachowski Brothers (Andy and Larry - last seen dabbling in kinky lesbian noir with the excellent Bound) pulling off something like a million masterstrokes all at once. Taking the imprimatur of the video game, they meld the grungy noir of Blade Runner, the hyperkinetic energies of chopsocky, John Woo hardware and grandiose spiritual overtones into William Gibson\'s cyberpunk ethos to produce a new aesthetic for the millennium powered to the thudding beat of techno. And it is just incredible fun. The key is the technique of ""flo-mo"", a process born from Japanese animation, whereby an object in motion is seemingly frozen while the camera miraculously spins around it as if time and gravity are on hold. It grants the action (including some killer kung fu which Reeves and crew spent months perfecting) liberty to take on surreal visual highs. Superhuman feats permissible, of course, in the context of VR as the rebels download Herculean ""talents"" to fuel their subterfuge. Meanwhile, the audience can only gawp longingly, with its jaws thunking to the cinema floor in unison, as the heroes wrapped in skintight leather, sleek shades and designer cheekbones, spin up walls, leap from high rises and slip through streams of bullets in silken slo-mo. Tron this ain\'t.\r\n\r\nImmediately reigniting the moribund cyberpunk genre (the kids can\'t get enough Stateside), this has thrust Reeves from his imploding career back to Speed highs (and laying to rest the hideous ghost of Johnny Mnemonic) and stolen much more of Star Wars\' thunder than was thought humanly possible. For all its loony plot, The Matrix is fabulous.\r\n\r\nSure, the expert Fishburne is depended upon to expound the lion\'s share of the script as seer-like rebel leader Morpheus. Reeves, stunning in his newcast slenderness, as Thomas ""Neo"" Anderson, the hacker turned hope for all mankind (care of some ill-defined mystical calling) is asked little more than perpetual befuddlement. Like Speed, though, this movie plays on his iconic looks rather than his oak-like emoting. There\'s a major find, too, in the irresistible Carrie-Anne Moss, a majestically wrought combination of steely no-shit intelligence and rock-chick vivaciousness as fellow tripper Trinity. And Weaving, cast against type, neutralises his Aussie tones to a freaky deadpan, the head of the MiB-styled defence system set against the Goth invaders.\r\n\r\nAnd sure, three minutes of post-movie deliberation and all this state-of-the-art cyberdevilry is reduced to the purest gobbledygook. That, though, is not the point. The Matrix is about pure experience; it\'s been many a moon since the Empire crew have spilled out of a cinema literally buzzing with the sensation of a movie, babbling frenetically with the sheer excitement of discovery.\r\n\r\nFrom head to tail, the deliciously inventive Wachowskis (watch them skyrocket) have delivered the syntax for a new kind of movie: technically mind-blowing, style merged perfectly with content and just so damn cool, the usher will have to drag you kicking and screaming back into reality.

The system is onto them, though, and using Hugo Weaving\'s ""Agent Smith"" and a fifth columnist from within the group\'s own ranks, is bent on their destruction. This film has that scarce value of having exciting (rather than delicately choreographed) action scenes married together with an intelligent, at times quite thought-provoking dialogue mixing fact/fiction and religiosity on a clever premiss that once we start to question reality; the conspiracy theories can run wild - and right to the top! Is ""Neo"" the one to save humanity - some sort of resurrected ""one""?

If there\'s one comment I deeply despise is the ""animated films are for children"". This preconceived notion is extremely dated, and honestly, quite childish. I don\'t even think it works within a teenage banter anymore since anime keeps growing exponentially around the world, and animated movies are reaching more and more people as time goes by. The whole ""you watch cartoons, you\'re a baby"" bullying statement to make friends laugh about someone is now decades-old. However, I still feel a bit of pity for people who believe animation can\'t have the same emotional impact than live-action, especially when a major studio like Pixar is known for making the most grown-up of adults cry like an infant.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, some viewers think that the latter studio owned by Disney is the only company making decent animated flicks when they\'ve been losing ground to other unbelievably talented people. One of my favorite animated films of all-time is Kubo and the Two Strings, a stop-motion animation work from Laika, the studio that also created Missing Link and Coraline. Cartoon Saloon is emerging as an awards-contender studio, by releasing movies such as Song of the Sea, The Breadwinner, and now Wolfwalkers. The main difference between this last company and the others is the style of animation: the ""old"" 2D animation that 90s kids like me grew up with.\r\n\r\nThat\'s precisely where I\'m starting this review. Wolfwalkers\' 2D animation proves once again that this style will never become ""dated"" or ""less than"" the current 3D design. Don\'t be mistaken, I love both styles! I\'m not part of the whole 2D vs 3D discourse simply because I firmly believe both have their own benefits and limitations. 2D animation brings a sense of uniqueness and artistry to any story due to the distinct drawing from many skilled artists, but it\'s more limited than 3D when it comes to creating an immersive atmosphere and its respective world. However, the latter is becoming stagnated in its design structure since almost every 3D animated flick visually feels and looks the same.\r\n\r\nSo, there\'s no good or bad, right or wrong, better or worse when it comes to animation. I can offer dozens of examples of exceptional, gorgeous-looking, utterly superb animated flicks from both styles, as well as awful, corporate-like films that I try my hardest to forget (looking at you, The Emoji Movie). Fortunately, Wolfwalkers belongs to the first group. Tomm Moore and Ross Stewart direct an emotionally heartwarming tale with seamless execution of every single aspect. Will Collins\' screenplay isn\'t particularly new or innovative though. It follows a somewhat generic, predictable story with key plot points that any viewer with minimum viewing experience will see coming from miles away.\r\n\r\nHowever, it\'s a formula that, if executed properly, still delivers a rich, passionate, captivating narrative, which will always please both children and adults. Just from the premise, it\'s pretty clear that the message of the movie is inspired by cliches such as ""don\'t judge people by their cover"" or ""our wants can steal someone else\'s needs"", and it even approaches racial discrimination since the film deals with two different populations. Obviously, having in mind one of these ""societies"" is a pack of wolves, there\'s also a message towards deforestation and excessive animal hunting, leading thousands of species to their eventual extinction. All of these themes are handled brilliantly, and it never feels preachy.\r\n\r\nIt doesn\'t matter how unsurprising the story ends up being when I feel as absorbed by the characters and the animation as I did. Honor Kneafsey and Eva Whittaker, as Robyn Goodfellowe and Mebh Óg MacTíre respectively, display phenomenal voice work, which is then elevated by the stunning, expressive, award-worthy animation. Sean Bean is also terrific as Bill Goodfellowe, Robyn\'s father, who basically possesses the character arc that goes through the significant change of acknowledging, understanding, and accepting an entirely different culture and its people (in this case, animals). Every character is incredibly well-written as are all dialogues, surrounded by a Celtic-inspired atmosphere, myths, and obviously, music.\r\n\r\nBruno Coulais and folk group Kíla developed the movie\'s original score, and it\'s undoubtedly one of my favorite soundtracks of 2020, including one of my favorite original songs (""Running with the Wolves"") in one of my favorite musical sequences of the year. ""Favorite"" is definitely the right one-word description of how I feel about Wolfwalkers. It\'s one of those films I can\'t really point out a single flaw. Massive praise to the drawing artists who designed such a fantastic 2D world. Their work is often unappreciated and underrated (besides being underpaid), so I want to offer Cartoon Saloon my biggest thank you, and keep making excellent cinema.\r\n\r\nI have no doubts: Wolfwalkers is, by far and so far, the best animated feature-film I\'ve seen all year. I know the big gun from Pixar is coming up (Soul), but it will have to be an absolutely perfect movie to surpass Tomm Moore and Ross Stewart\'s beautifully heartwarming Celtic-inspired tale. Cartoon Saloon continues to prove that 2D animation is still capable of delivering emotionally compelling stories through gorgeous-looking, unique, artistic drawings. Despite Will Collins\'s generic narrative and cliche messages, every single detail is executed perfectly, without a single flaw to point out. Outstanding voice work from Honor Kneafsey and Eva Whittaker as the well-written, captivating protagonists. However, it\'s Bruno Coulais and Kíla\'s original score that melts my heart and sends chills down my spine every time I listen to it. One of my favorite films of the year, I\'d be extremely surprised with myself if it doesn\'t end on my Top10. Watch it with your family. It\'s worth it.\r\n\r\nRating: A', ""With its multi-layered metaphysical storytelling and rich animation, 'Wolfwalkers' is basically the only reason to acknowledge Apple TV+ at the moment. It also reaffirms that Cartoon Saloon makes animated films that culturally literate adults can watch without needing a pint-sized companion as pretext. After watching it, you'll see why the studio is destined to become just as legendary as Laika and Ghibli.\r\n- Jake Watt\r\n\r\nRead Jake's full article...\r\nhttps://www.maketheswitch.com.au/article/review-wolfwalkers-a-gorgeously-animated-irish-fable""]"

There is some excellent combination of 3D animation with 2D styles that I have not seen before. The combat frame rate shift was also a nice touch that worked better than I was expecting. Action was top notch with some incredible set pieces and superb choreography.\r\n\r\nThe Last Wish deals with some pretty heavy themes for an animated children's movie. Death is something that all humans will have to face which was handled in such a nuanced and mature way here. From panic attacks to haunting imagery, death looms large throughout the entire film and serves as a menacing villain. The journey our heroes take to confront this fear is very heartwarming and will resonant with most audience members.\r\n\r\nWith most DreamWorks pictures, the comedy is targeted at both children and adults. I did find myself laughing out loud at plenty of jokes, but just as many landed flat for me. This would be more of an issue, but this is an incredibly balanced film with great action and dramatic moments that leave little room for a few flat jokes to make a large impact on my experience.\r\n\r\nI genuinely believe that this movie has restored the Shrek universe and can propel the future projects upward. Hype has officially been restored for Shrek 5!\r\n\r\nScore: 86%\r\nVerdict: Great"", ""I did not expect the sequel to a decent spin-off Dreamworks film from over a decade ago to be one of the most poignant, introspective, genuinely hilarious, and heartwarming films of the year. But here we are.\r\n\r\nAfter an overly cheesy, somewhat clunky opening sequence, The Last Wish very quickly begins developing its zany assortment of characters into distinct quirky personalities with sympathetic desires and clear goals. The film juggles several character arcs and it's almost miraculous how it successfully handled all of them with proper set up and satisfying, emotionally weighty payoffs.\r\n\r\nThe screenplay is wacky, witty, and also bursting with heart as it deals with weighty themes of trusting others and finding purpose in any circumstances. And it tackles these themes in ways that are always understandable to all ages but never insultingly oversimplified.\r\n\r\nWhat I also didn't expect was that the action sequences would be so well-choreographed and beautifully animated, and that the movie would often be terrifying and violent at times.\r\n\r\nI adored this film. I think it's Dreamworks' best film since Megamind and it's easily the best true family film of the year."", 'I can\'t think for a minute that this would have worked at all, had it not for been for the entertainingly over-the-top voice talents of Antonio Banderas in the title roll. His cat is a sort of combination of Cyrano de Bergerac and Casanova - full of flair, dashing and adept with his flourishing blade. Until, that is, he has a run-in with a church bell that brings him face to face with his mortality. He has only one of his nine lives left, and death is poised to come claim him! Shattered, he seeks refuge in a home for cats where he encounters ""Perrito"" - a small, naive and lost little dog who is determined to befriend him. Meantime, the not so little ""Jack Horner"" and ""Goldilocks"" and her three bears are looking for a map that will guide them to a wishing star that, well, it does what it says on the tin. The bears decide to track down our eponymous hero to help them procure it, but he and his feline rival ""Kitty"" (and their new doggy pal) decide to join forces and must face a series of tortuous escapades in the race to succeed in their quest. It must be 45 years since I last read the ""Goldilocks"" story and try as I might, I just couldn\'t remember it as it gradually evolves as one of the threads of this enjoyably crafted montage of fable and charisma. It\'s pretty action packed with Banderas proving his singing hasn\'t really improved much since ""Evita"" (1996). It\'s a family movie for sure with messages of loyalty, affection, determination etc.; but there is still enough in the dialogue for those older folks in the auditorium to raise a smile and keep it interesting for 100 minutes. The animation is super and this character driven adventure is well worth seeing on a big screen if you can. Maybe not one for tiny kids - but for us bigger ones, this is fun.', ""This one sort of slipped through the cracks didn't it?  I mean, it has a very good, very heartwarming story that helps define a character's growth over the length of the plot.  It has a story about hope and sacrifice and struggle.\r\n\r\nIt is a good movie.\r\n\r\nHow does a movie this good get made today?  Isn't this sort of the opposite of everything that current Hollywood stands for?\r\n\r\nWhere is the strong female lead replacing Puss in Boots as the hero?  Where are the identity politics?  Where is the nonstop shaming of Straight White Men?  Where is the depiction of half the country as absolute evil?  \r\n\r\nHow can they make a western movie that doesn't shame the west at every possible turn?\r\n\r\nI have absolutely no idea how this could have been made, but what I can say is that it is fantastic, it is moving, it is fun for the whole family and it has a decent nonpolitical message.  The main character is heroic.  This is just... well, this is a movie that doesn't seem like it could possibly be made in today's Hollywood."", 'Really good movie better then the first. I loved the beard it was pretty funny looking. The storyline was way better then part one.', ""A sequel miles better than the (good) original - that's a rarity!\r\n\r\nThose behind <em>'Puss in Boots: The Last Wish'</em> absolutely smashed it out the park with this one. I had heard murmurs of hype about it so was expecting it to be very good, yet it still managed to surpass my expectations. It features a great story with well utilised characters, of which there are quite a few.\r\n\r\nSoon after hitting play I wasn't actually sure about the animation, for one Puss himself looked different to how I remember him from <em>'Shrek'</em>. However, those thoughts quickly disappeared because the style is, in fact, gorgeous. You can tell the people making this had heart in it, rather than just milking the IP for another installment.\r\n\r\nAntonio Banderas remains a joy as Puss in Boots, a character that wouldn't be as memorable without him. Harvey Guillén comes in with a standout showing, I do think Perrito is the least interesting visually but the character (and voice) is what makes the dog a successful addition. John Mulaney (thought it was Zach Braff, ngl) is a positive newbie too.\r\n\r\nFlorence Pugh, Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone and Samson Kayo are also pluses, as are Salma Hayek and Wagner Moura. Evidently, it's a quality cast. A minor shame we didn't get anyone big back from the original series, though I do approve with how this one concludes in that regard.""]"

It is an epic masterpiece in many ways and it really explains why despite the numerous viewings, Gladiator still amuses me with its powerful imageries and many other crucial aspects so that it won five Academy Awards. This film is very well written, the well-ensemble casts, the A-class acting (especially Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix), the stunning cinematography and definitely a strong character of Maximus (magnificently portrayed by Russell Crowe) whose life, struggle, disappointment and anger really move the audience, as if the world attention centers on him. Gladiator is not a historical film, because it only used the history of the ancient Roman Empire merely as the time setting.\r\nAll other aspects namely those gorgeous shots, the great storyline/plot, the fantastic cinematography, the vividly lavish colors, detailed production design and digital imaging (that successfully rebuilt the stunning beauty of the ancient Roman Empire) and all sell really well, making the 170 minute-long running time definitely worthwhile. The visual of great battle in the first 15 minutes really stole my heart. The gruesome pictures, the blood and violence just to beautiful to abandon. Everything in this movie seems perfectly balanced, Ridley Scott as the film director really did his homework well in redefining and revitalizing the big battle sequence once considered masterpiece from Spartacus and Ben Hur. In the end, once again, I would say that Gladiator perfectly combines some crucial elements such as good, moving story, dazzling visual, beautiful scenery, filming techniques, direction and touching music score into one harmonious, action-packed film about heroism and its true meaning.', 'They said you were a giant. They said you can crush a man\'s skull with one hand.\r\n\r\nRidley Scott\'s Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I\'m firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.\r\n\r\nIn narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann\'s 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator\'s success is there for all to see.\r\n\r\nWhat we do in life echoes in eternity.\r\n\r\nSo no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there\'s a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel, actually overrides film making irks. Crowe\'s Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life\'s pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny - with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.\r\n\r\nBacking Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen\'s turn here against that of Diane Kruger\'s in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that\'s inspiring.\r\n\r\nI didn\'t know man could build such things.\r\n\r\nDialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men\'s destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10', ""Ridley Scott's Gladiator is a real masterpiece of its genre. With its unique battle scenes, cinematography, acting and directing. It's a real must-watch. Shame on you if you haven't watched this movie!"", 'This has got just about everything from ""Spartacus"" (1960) to ""Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire"" (1964) via a bit of ""Quo Vadis"" (1951) to it - and Ridley Scott has managed to create a magnificent spectacle of a film. Russell Crowe is the eponymous soldier ""Maximus"". Commander of the Armies of the Rhine for Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) and his designated successor - until, that is, the emperor\'s son ""Commodus"" (Joaquin Phoenix) and his sister ""Lucilla"" (an efficient Connie Nielsen) arrive and suddenly it\'s all change at the top. Betrayed and left for dead, our hero must now make other shifts if he is to survive in his new world - controlled by slave-owning ""Proximo"" (Oliver Reed) and deliver him of vengeance on his new Imperial nemesis. The film looks great, the cast - including some some strong supporting efforts from Sir Derek Jacobi, John Shrapnel, Djimon Hounsou and Tomas Arana all contribute well to this grandeur of this historical saga. The high politics, betrayal and duplicity are matched with a sense of integrity and camaraderie as ""Maximus"" begins to galvanise his colleagues and his political allies into something more than a disparate band fighting just to survive each day. Reed and Harris both feature only sparingly, but both add a richness to the characterisations that are dominated by two on-form performances from Crowe and Phoenix that epitomise a struggle of good versus evil and ultimate power in an empire where corruption and brutality trade human life as if it were a watermelon. Add to this some superb visual effects and a rousing score from Hans Zimmer (and Lisa Gerrard) and we have a compelling watch on a big screen that shows there is still a glimmer of the Cecil B. De Mille spirit left in Hollywood.', '""Gladiator,"" directed by Ridley Scott and released in 2000, is undeniably one of the best movies ever made. A cinematic masterpiece that effortlessly blends action, drama, and history, this film leaves an indelible mark on all who watch it.\r\n\r\nAt the heart of ""Gladiator"" are the remarkable performances by Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix. Crowe\'s portrayal of Maximus Decimus Meridius is nothing short of breathtaking. His stoic determination, unwavering loyalty, and charismatic presence make him the perfect embodiment of a hero. Joaquin Phoenix, on the other hand, delivers a chillingly convincing performance as the treacherous Commodus. His portrayal of the power-hungry and morally bankrupt emperor is both mesmerizing and repulsive, showcasing his exceptional acting prowess.\r\n\r\nWhat sets ""Gladiator"" apart from other films is its ability to evoke genuine emotions. The story of Maximus, a loyal general who seeks revenge for the murder of his family and the betrayal of his emperor, touches the very core of our humanity. The film explores themes of honor, justice, and the indomitable spirit of the human soul, making it a truly timeless narrative.\r\n\r\nI would rewatch it anytime and recommend it to anyone. It\'s a solid 10/10, truly an amazing masterpiece.', 'An epic old movie, an absolute must watch. Even now, I can’t resist running my hands over tall plants whenever I pass by them']"

The focus is on a Captain (Tom Hanks) and his men who are commissioned to find a paratrooper (Matt Damon) whose brothers have been killed in action.\r\n\r\nNo one\'s supposed to say anything bad about SPR. To do so is considered sacrilege, but I have to be honest about what I like and don\'t like about Spielberg\'s popular WWII war flick. The initial beach landing (shot at Curracloe Beach, Ballinesker, Ireland) is outstanding, as is the closing half-hour battle at the crumbling village of Ramelle.\r\n\r\nIn between these two great bookends are a few quality sequences, but I didn\'t find a lot of the drama all that engaging or convincing. The cast is notable (also including Tom Sizemore, Barry Pepper, Edward Burns, Giovanni Ribisi, Jeremy Davies, Vin Diesel, et al.), but the characters never struck me as real for the most part. I\'ve seen the film three times and each time I was too often conscious of the fact that I was watching actors portraying WWII characters in a movie. When you see a truly great picture, by contrast, you completely forget you\'re watching a movie, e.g. the original ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979).\r\n\r\nMoreover, too many of the situations in SPR, including the dialogue, simply struck me as unreal or annoyingly treacly. Exhibit A is the moronic dog-tag sequence, which was supposed to be emotionally stirring but just made me roll my eyes. But, like I said, no one can criticize SPR and get away with it, even if the criticism is legitimate. It\'s like you\'ll be accused of being un-American or something, which is far from the case with me since I love America; I just can\'t stand the corrupt government & politicians, particularly the loony DemonKKKraps.\r\n\r\nIn light of my criticisms, I simply don\'t get why so many praise SPR as ""the greatest war movie ever made."" Again, the opening and ending battle sequences are great but the dubious dramatics leave quite a bit to be desired.\r\n\r\nI\'ve heard SPR hailed on the grounds that much of it was taken ""verbatim from first-hand, eye-witness accounts of the real Normandy invasion."" I\'ll take their word for it, but this isn\'t what I object to. I object to the contrived, sappy, questionable way Spielberg depicted the dramatics and the fact that I was unable to buy the characters as real. The aforementioned dog-tag sequence is just one example, others include the French father’s stupefying actions and the forced fight at the radar station and how it’s resolved (ooh, the Captain’s a high school teacher, whoopee).\r\n\r\nNevertheless, there IS a lot of good in SPR that makes it worth viewing. You can’t beat the battle sequences, the cast and the convincing WWII visuals throughout.\r\n\r\nTHE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours, 49 minutes and was shot in Ireland, England and France. WRITER: Robert Rodat.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C+/B-', 'This movie should be known for changing Historical War Dramas as we know them. It was the first to accurately depict the carnage of war, and changed the direction of this genre of movies for all time. The initial D-Day scene was fantastic. Afterwards, Tom Hanks is ordered to chose a team of his men and look for James MacGuffin Ryan from Iowa. In order to achieve this goal, Hanks takes us across the entire back drop of world war 2, all the while making us ask, is all this worth  just one man?\r\n\r\nHonestly it\'s a must watch and is on my ""Difinitive Movie List""', 'I watched this movie during a project at school. Saving Private Ryan was a beautiful and, above all, realistic film. The film presented in a realistic way how the war went then. Most of the film was set in Europe in 1944. The story is that American soldiers are being sent to Europe to fight against the Germans. The American boy James Francis Ryan is sent to Europe with his brothers as a soldier. After the invasion of Normandy it appears that all his other brothers have already died and he is the only one left. That is why corporal Miller is instructed to look for him and return him home.\r\nThe main actors who play in the film are Tom Hanks who plays corporal Miller and Matt Damon who plays the soldier Ryan. You also have all the soldiers in the group of corporal Miller. I think the characters in the film are very well thought out because they contain characters that are very brave, but also characters who have a hard time in the war. With this they show that not every soldier was as heroic as everyone thought.\r\nThe film was made on a set that I thought looked very realistic. In the background you saw the buildings that were about to collapse and the shots. I also really liked the sound that came with the film. For example, when a tank arrived, you heard that it was slowly approaching.', ""Recensie saving private Ryan\r\n\r\nInformation about the movie\r\nTitle: Saving Private Ryan\r\nRegisseur: Steven Spielberg\r\nMost important actors: Tom Hanks as Captain Miller en Matt Damon as Private Ryan\r\nGenre: War, Drama and history \r\nSetting: Normandy, France\r\nPlot: During WWII, Chief of Staff, General Marshall is informed that three of a woman's sons have been killed and that she's going to receive the notifications of their demise at the same time. And when he learns that a fourth son is still unaccounted for, the General decides to send a unit to find him and bring him back, despite being told that it's highly unlikely that he is still alive and the area that he was known to be at is very dangerous. So, the unit consisting of 8 men are sent to find him but as stated it's very dangerous and one by one, they are picked off. Will they find him and how many of them will still be alive?\r\n\r\nI saw this movie at school. I think it's a good film because, the director is very good because it seemed like you were really in it because the camera moved with it. In the quiet parts, the image was also quiet and when it became chaotic, the image was also chaotic. The characters were very realistic and felt as if they were really in a war, and for the costumes it looked very real and the same for the decor it looked like you were in war in France. I liked the movie but thought it was a bit too long, so I give it a 9/10."", 'I don\'t think I can recall any Hollywood film that depicts the atrocities of the D-Day landings as effectively as this does at the start. Indeed, watching it you wonder just how any of the Allied soldiers managed to ever survive the water let alone fight their way up a beach crowded with tank traps, mines and barbed wire - all whilst under constant machine gun fire. Steven Spielberg leaves very little to our imagination and bodies drop left, right and centre with an authenticity that John Williams scores remarkably poignantly. It\'s during this seemingly impossible assault that we are introduced to ""Miller"" (a career-best from Tom Hanks) and his squad who are tasked with taking out one of the heavily defended pill boxes. Meantime, the US Chief of Staff - General George Marshall is informed that one particular lady is about to get three telegrams in one day telling her that her sons have died. There is a fourth - ""James"" - and the reward for ""Miller"" and what\'s left of his group is to find this man and get him home to safety. What\'s also illustrated quite succinctly here is that despite the most meticulous of planning, nobody really has much of a clue who had landed where, who was alive or dead, and whether or not the master plan was working or not! This makes the new task even more difficult as the men, along with the dragooned interpreter ""Upham"" (Jeremy Davis) set of in search of a man they don\'t know with feelings that can only be described as ""mixed"" about the legitimacy of their mission. What now ensues is a potent story of war and of how the pressures and horrors of constant fear and weariness can corrupt the the most decent of souls. We see these men - decent men - turn into things they would never have thought themselves capable of becoming and the acting really rams that home in a characterful and visceral fashion. Brutality and savagery are not limited to the Nazis and again these images are presented to us with an honesty rather from a rose-tinted good v evil viewpoint and the dialogue has a ripeness and vivacity that rings true, too. It\'s not devoid of some black humour as we progress through war-torn France before a denouement that combines edge-of-the-seat drama with splendid cinematography and all of the ghastliness of conflict. The men valued each other as much as anything else, their inter-reliance and their determination to get the job done - even if they didn\'t really know why - is a testament to the attitudes that prevailed throughout the real fighting in Europe during WWII and this dramatisation is stunning. Big screen if you can - but it\'s really a must watch.']"

Aldo Raine.\r\n\r\nThis was my first taste of the popular director\'s eccentric repertoire, although I\'ve since seen all of his movies. The first time I tried to watch ""Basterds"" I gave up around the 50-minute mark. Don\'t get me wrong, the dialogue-driven opening sequence is great but the film seemed to bog down with its focus on a French theater during the German occupation and the accompanying interminable dialogue (mostly in subtitles). I just wasn\'t ready for this because I was expecting a Dirty Dozen-styled WW2 film with lots of action and all that goes with it. What I got instead was a plot that focused on the aforementioned theater accompanied by long sessions of generally subtitled dialogue.\r\n\r\nI eventually gave it a second chance with the understanding that this wasn\'t some typical war flick. Strangely, the ""interminable dialogue"" pulled me in and I slowly became engrossed in the story, which isn\'t hard to follow. The drama is only occasionally interrupted by flashes of extreme violence. Until the end, that is, where all hell literally breaks loose.\r\n\r\nThere ARE elements that bring to mind ""The Dirty Dozen"" (1967), including a group of anti-heroes intent on mercilessly obliterating as many Germans as possible and the fact that the real action doesn\'t kick-in until the final act, but ""Basterds"" is hardly a Dirty Dozen clone. It may borrow a bit from notable films of the past but it absolutely possesses its own refreshing originality.\r\n\r\nAll effective films have quality characters and ""Basterds"" has several: The stunning Mélanie Laurent as Shosanna, the cinema proprietor who quietly seethes with retribution; Christoph Waltz as SS Col. Hans Landa, an articulate and suave love-to-hate villain who mercilessly hunts down Jews; Brad Pitt as the almost-comical, but no-nonsense leader of the brutal Basterds; super-sharp Diane Kruger as a German actress & British spy; and Daniel Brühl as a genial German hero with the hots for the beautiful Shosanna.\r\n\r\nLike Tarantino’s other great movies (“Pulp Fiction,” “Django Unchained” and “Jackie Brown”), ""Basterds"" pulsates with confidence, style, quirkiness and a sense of the unexpected from beginning to end, the perfect antidote to the idiotic ""blockbuster"" syndrome that plagues modern cinema with its predictability and overKILL action & CGI, etc. Most movies seem like they’re in a rush and shy away from extended dialogues because they fear losing the viewer’s limited attention whereas Tarantino makes them a highlight because it’s an area where he excels. Instead of pedestrian verbiage that merely advances the plot or conveys the obvious, his interchanges are rich with amusement and mindfood.\r\n\r\nTHE FILM RUNS 153 minutes and was shot in France and Germany.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A-', ""Second time seeing this since it was released on Blu-ray in 2009 and still is a solid war-thriller with Tarantino's flair with dialogue and of course, feet.

I know, I know… Spoiler-free? For a movie released in 1980? Well, first of all, there’s always someone who still didn’t watch it. Secondly, as deeper we get into the 21st century, the more the 60s/70s/80s/90s movies are forgotten. And finally, if there’s a movie which I don’t need spoilers to explain how outstanding it is, it’s The Shining. With that said …\r\n\r\nIt has always been one of my favorite horror films ever. It’s not perfect (no film is) and some aspects don’t work as well now as they did 5/10/20 years ago. When it came out, Kubrick’s adaptation of Stephen King’s novel was received with mixed reactions. King himself criticized the movie. However, less than 10 years later, Kubrick’s film was already being reevaluated. Nowadays, it’s considered a cult classic, and it’s easy to understand why. From the countless homages to the hundreds of comedic parodies, The Shining has some of the most memorable lines ever. Just this year, we had It: Chapter Two mimicking Jack Nicholson’s “Here’s Johnny!” scene, for example. And then there’s the mysterious “redrum”…\r\n\r\nHowever, the movie’s biggest influence is its technical achievements. I apologize in advance if this review becomes too technical, but it’s impossible not to address the arguably best component of the film. This movie was one of the first to use Steadicam (a camera stabilizer mount which allows for smooth shots, even on irregular surfaces, isolating the operator’s movement), something that became so common that people don’t even praise anymore. Honestly, there are still a bunch of recent movies that have terrible camera work, so I’m one of those who defend that the Steadicam use shouldn’t be taken for granted. Especially how Kubrick did, barely above the floor, which originated the extension “low-mode” that now exists and allows for the operator to easily shoot lower than its waist.\r\n\r\nWith the innovative use of the technical equipment, Kubrick’s delivers a masterclass in framing (composing the visual content of a series of frames as seen from a point of view). So much that it became worthy of studying. Almost every shot in this movie has a visual clue or an underlying theme. If you ever feel bored during your viewing, then you’re (probably) not “watching it right”. You’re not truly thinking about it or looking around the characters. This isn’t a generic horror flick with monsters or demons jump scaring you. It’s heavy on visual storytelling, so if you don’t pay attention, you’re going to reach the film’s climactic and enigmatic ending and feel that you missed something.\r\n\r\nFrom the mise-en-scene (arrangement of everything that appears in the framing, hence this French term that means “placing on stage“) having several blood-red colors to the wide shots clearly showing “exit” signs and giving the maze-vibe of the enormous hotel, the imminent danger is visually spread out across the movie. The symmetry/mirroring is absolutely crucial to not only deliver key plot points but to create this sense of reality vs fantasy. From the hotel’s structure and decoration (everything is incredibly symmetric) to the growing use of mirrors (these are heavily used to either literally translate words or to show the descent into madness), Kubrick’s framing is what leaves viewers scratching their heads, still to this date.\r\n\r\nYou’ll always find something new on another viewing. It might be from 1980, but it’s a movie that requires your full attention. Don’t underestimate films from the 20th century like you can’t be surprised by a film “that old” (you’ll be dumbfounded by dozens). If John Alcott’s cinematography is impressive, then what can I write about Wendy Carlos and Rachel Elkind’s haunting score? Nowadays, scores are more based on creating an emotional impact on specific moments. However, throughout the film and during dialogues, even epic films still have a subtlest approach to these scenes, and the music is either very quiet or completely inexistent.\r\n\r\nIn The Shining, the score is part of the conversation. If a character feels fear or danger is imminent, a simple heartbeat can elevate such a moment. If two characters gradually turn their dialogue into something more violent and aggressive, the music makes sure to accompany that descent into craziness. It’s a perfect horror film’s score. Technically, I’ll stop there because no words will be able to express how mind-blowing Kubrick’s visionary methods are. He’s one of the greatest directors ever, maybe even the most influential. Hopefully, his work will always be remembered and never stop being relevant.\r\n\r\nStory-wise, The Shining also inspired a whole new generation. Everyone knows and loves the key moments of the film, but it’s the clever exposition that satisfies me. Every piece of information is given through either an incredibly captivating dialogue or visual clues/actions. I watched the 144min version of the film (the European version has 25min less than the American version, and the latter has a final scene at a hospital edited out by Kubrick himself), and pretty much every single scene is intended to mean something. It can be important new information or an update on a previous plot point, but every single sequence has a particular purpose.\r\n\r\nJack Nicholson commands the screen with a phenomenal performance, one of his career’s best. His script might be very well-written, but his delivery and commitment to the role are astonishing. He carries one-take, extense dialogues seamlessly. Credit to Kubrick for making a movie with at least 2/3-minute takes, sure, but Nicholson is able to transform a good scene into a fantastic one. Danny Lloyd delivers one of my favorite young performances ever. His voice as Tony is a great accomplishment, and he seems to understand his surroundings, in a way that I never felt like I needed to “go easy” on him because he’s just impeccable. \r\n\r\nShelley Duvall, however, is a mixed bag for me. Over-the-top displays were better received at the time, but almost 40 years later, her performance does reach an unbearable level a few times. She’s an amazing counterpart for Nicholson and she stands her own within their dialogues, but when she’s alone or in an emotionally troubled moment, she’s too much to handle. Scatman Crothers doesn’t have that much screentime as Dick Halloran, but he shines every time he has to deliver a line. Some people complain about the slow pacing, but I love how it helps elevate the suspense and building up moments of immense tension. While the ending might be just a tad abrupt, the final image of the film stays with us forever, and after all this time, I still didn’t settle on my own theory.\r\n\r\nAll in all, The Shining might be one of the most accessible classics to new viewers of today to understand why it is, in fact, one of the greatest and most influential horror films of all-time. Stanley Kubrick’s masterclass in framing with his play on symmetry and mirrors is evident, so even if you don’t study the art of filmmaking, it’s clear that these two themes are vital to telling the story. In addition to his framing, his use of the innovative Steadicam and his notable mise-en-scene shaped an entire new generation that never misses a chance of paying homage to his work. Besides the impressive technical achievements, Jack Nicholson delivers a memorably haunting performance. The ending is still mind-blowing after all these years, and new theories keep coming up. While I’ll keep trying to settle on my own interpretation, don’t you dare spend the rest of your life without (re)watching this cult classic.\r\n\r\nRating: A+', '""Darling, I\'m not gonna hurt you.

But if you don't, then you must. His films are definitely for the grown ups. Like everybody else, my admiration for his work has started a decade ago with the film 'Oldboy'. He had tried his luck in Hollywood with 'Stoker'. Despite a good entertainer, it was criticised. I love Park Chan-wook doing hundred masterpieces like this in Korea than trying to do one in Hollywood. His ability to turn the good book into a great flick was phenomenal. Here it goes another one. This was based on the British novel 'Fingersmith' by Sarah Waters. The story of an orphan woman who assigned to be a maid for a young rich woman who is living under the shadow of her uncle since she has no parents.\r\n\r\nYeah, I was expecting it, but I did not think it would be another masterpiece from the director. I even thought the ratings could be exaggerated, and the reviews from his die hard fans like Nolan's or QT's fans does. The timeline of the story was prior to Second World War Korea under the Japan rule. A perfect setting for such theme. The film opened like it is an average film. That's where all I got wrong. Or probably I judged it too soon. The storytelling was split into three parts and the first part was a bit mix of fun and like any film, introduction, the platform for the rest of the narration filled with surprises.\r\n\r\nThe young orphan Sook-hee was recruited by a thief who is planning to trick a young woman named Lady Hideko with all the wealth left behind by her parents. The only obstacle for him is her uncle, a guardian. So Sook-hee becomes close to her. More than she had expected, but their plan is working. Now they have to wait for the perfect moment for a perfect strike. When it arrives, an unexpected twist takes the tale to go back to where the film originally had started. But even further earlier and this time, the perspective of the story was from the Lady Hdeko.\r\n\r\n> ❝So even if my love for you leads me to ruin, don't pity me.❞\r\n\r\nSo, with that flashback, the second part begins. But literally it was a series of twist, that keep explaining us in another angle of the whole scenario I had witnessed in the previous part. Believe me, I have never seen such a long twist before. I was like unmoved for that entire segment. One of the best things I have ever in a film. The praise must go to the author, but the director and his actors as well did a fine job. There's a twist in every scene. So, for that one must pay close attention to the first part, despite slow moving story.\r\n\r\nBut above all, what I'm surprised was I did not know it was a lesbian film. Moreover, I did not think it could have bold scenes for such theme. Everything seemed perfect. I mean the erotic parts are sensual, but very artistic than unnecessary disturbance. Mainly because of stronger hold of the story narration than anything else. Even the pace picks up, like a crazy speed. Everything about the film you would learn in this section. All the secrets of the past revealed and what might comes are still kept under mysterious for the third and final part.\r\n\r\nThe most awaited, the conclusion part begins forth. For everything we saw so far, what might come after makes this film at its best. Just like the mid part, this is also full of twists. Because it will going to tell who ends where and what they get. Over two hours long film, and every frame are worth. The casting was best and so the setting of the 1930s Korea. Especially I must applaud the filmmaker's effort to turn the original setting from Europe to East Asia. It was great, but still now and then you can see the influence of the original source. I mean western culture, names, architect references which might have come from the book.\r\n\r\nNot just the lesbian or a love triangle story, but something like a circle of love with deceive and defraud. You can notice that in the film poster with four main characters. So when it has a multiple strings attached, you could expect surprises/twists from each angle and it gives that more the convincingly. Put this into your must see list. This is not the first screen adaptation, but surely the best so far. Now we can expect a European or a Hollywood project in a big scale soon. Believe me the Oscars would pour in, because it's that kind of story. Highly recommended!\r\n\r\n_8/10_"", 'Talk about the best laid plans! This is a cracking, sexy, thriller set in Korea during the Japanese occupation of the 1930s. It centres around the charming, butter-wouldn\'t-melt ""Sook-Hee"" (Tae Ri Kim) who takes a job attending the wealthy ""Lady Hideko"" (Kim Min-hee). She lives on a grand estate with her cantankerous uncle ""Kouzuki"" (Cho Jin-woong) and is frankly rather low maintenance for her new maid. Pretty quickly, though, we begin to smell a rat! Is she what she seems, and what has the obviously duplicitous ""Count"" (Ha Jung-woo) got to do with things? Well gradually, we find out that there are schemes afoot to rob the lady of her fortune, her liberty - even her mind. What the plotting didn\'t take account for, though, was human nature. A bond gradually starts to build between the two women, a bond of friendship, of trust - of love! What happens next...? This benefits hugely from having a tightly-knit cast who work well together; a solid and intriguing story that marries the Machiavelian with the mischievous, the sexy with the sordid - and, it looks great too. The characters vacillate from being likeable, kinky, and often pretty loathsome in equal measure, but somehow there is always a sense that right will be done! I loved the ending, and the performances from the two women are engaging and captivating. Some of it isn\'t for the squeamish, but it flew by, is expertly crafted, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.']"

A must to be seen.', 'I just watched The Help, almost immediately after finishing the book. Now, when comparing The Film to The Book it was based on (generally speaking), one major rule of thumb almost always applies: The Book is better. The Help is no exception.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, with the novel still so fresh in the back of my mind, separating my mind from the book in order to enjoy the film was an almost impossible task. No matter how hard you try, you just can\'t quit comparing the two, nitpicking every detail and being frustrated with everything they changed. Nevertheless, I was still able to enjoy the film for what it was, though I am glad that I possessed full knowledge of the actual story.\r\n\r\nThe Help tells the story of black domestic servants in 1960\'s Jackson, Mississippi. It focuses on white Miss Eugenia \'Skeeter\' Phelan, and her efforts to give a voice to black maids by writing their stories from their perspective and thus giving them an opportunity to be heard for the first time in their lives. Among the black women, Aibileen and Minny are the two key characters.\r\n\r\nSo let\'s just get the ""bad"" stuff out of the way. One of the elements in the novel that I enjoyed the most was the incredibly delicate bond of trust and understanding that builds up (over an extensive period of time) between Aibileen and Skeeter. It really does take Skeeter a long time before she finally wins Aibileen over and convinces her to share her deepest feelings with a white woman. In the film, this process felt rather rushed, like Aibileen just woke up the next morning and decided to do it. What bothers me about this is not just the fact that (oh, cliché) it was ""better"" in the book, but mostly because the film forgets to underline WHY it took so long. Not only is it much more clearly explained in writing that these black women face an incredible danger in divulging their true feelings about the white women they work for, the film also fails to capture the palpable tension and sense of urgency of the book. These women aren\'t just risking their jobs, they are risking their lives, AND the lives of their loved ones. They\'re in danger just for being seen talking to a white lady. I found this to be a rather big flaw of the film.\r\n\r\nThe film also lacks a lot of the character development I was hoping for. Quite a few character changes were made, so that in the film they all just kind of appear out of nowhere, and more or less seem to go about their business without – again – the big ""why"" of it all. One of the most underexposed characters was a woman named Celia Foote, who is a poor white trash girl who married way out of her league – and because of it, has to face the constant disgrace and condescension from the other stuck-up, ""sophisticated"" white ladies. Celia is just the sweetest, loveliest person in the entire story, and her relationship with her maid Minny is heart warming. The fact that they barely included this in the film is a real shame.\r\n\r\nOK – if I keep comparing the film to the book, this review will never reach its end. Obviously, there is a lot more I could (and certainly want to) say, but it\'s not really relevant to the effectiveness of this review. So, moving on.\r\n\r\nAt least they got the actors right! Each and every one of them was cast spot-on to their character. Emma Stone is wonderful as Skeeter –capturing her youthful daring and naiveté perfectly. There\'s also something about her voice and attitude that make it clear that this girl is different from her snooty bridge club peers. Viola Davis is the perfect Aibileen – all I kept thinking was, damn, she should have gotten that Oscar. Her performance is very moving and heartfelt. Octavia Spencer did actually win an Oscar for her role as Minny, and it was well deserved. She is exactly as I imagined Minny to be – sassy, smart-mouthed and with an attitude that could render any white woman speechless, even if it means losing her job a dozen times. Celia Foote is played by Jessica Chastain, and I fear I\'m at risk of doubling over in superlatives to describe how perfect she was, so I\'ll just leave it at this.\r\n\r\nThe Evil Witch in this story is Hilly Holbrook, played by Bryce Dallas Howard. I\'m not sure how big of a compliment it is to say that she is very good at playing a snide, cunning racist – so let\'s just say she is a very good actress. Another actress worth mentioning is Allison Janney, who plays the role of Skeeter\'s mother. Though she is not quite like I imagined her the way she was in the book (there we go again...), I always enjoy her performances very much and this one\'s no exception. Oh, and Sissy Spacek plays Hilly\'s mother, and she is a delight to watch. I got the feeling that the director extended her role to a little more than what it was in the book, just to give her more screen time. I don\'t blame him.\r\n\r\nOverall, the film is properly paced and reasonably well-constructed, though some creative liberties are taken here and there considering the timeline. In comparison to the book, it is a little disappointing, but I can\'t think of a single book-to-film adaptation where this wasn\'t the case.\r\n\r\nI still rate The Help 8 out of 10, because I think it is an important story to be told and the performances are stellar, but if you have a little more patience, I strongly recommend reading the book instead.\r\n_(March 2013)_', ""Great watch, probably won't watch again, and can recommend.\r\n\r\nTo be fair, you should watch this prepared for what it is: \r\na racial suffrage movie.\r\n\r\nThat means that it is filled with racism and unfair strife, and stupid jerks of the elite class that are under the impression that they can still buy and sell people because they do.\r\n\r\nThis is a fantastic movie, but it is a heavy, serious story, and the humor in it barely makes it more palatable in that regard.\r\n\r\nThe cast is filled with great actresses who give excellent performances, the script is well written, and the production value is great.\r\n\r\nIt isn't going to provide a level of escapism from worldly problems, but I don't have to like a movie to recognize its greatness.""]"

But _Tyrone Power_ and _Marlene Dietrich_ were convincing too in their portrayal of an _innocent, afraid for his life man and a disloyal, unloving, poker faced wife_ respectively.\r\n\r\nSome people might say that they predicted the ending half way down the movie but i am not quite sure as to how they predicted the **ACTUAL ENDING** before it really unfolded before their eyes?\r\n\r\nThis movie is great not only in the part played in court but also in the scenes shot in _Sir Wilfrid Robarts\'s_ office(also due to _Miss Plimsoll\'s caringly lovably irritating character!_).\r\n\r\nPerhaps the people(the minority I\'d like to believe) who don\'t think this movie deserves the high ranking and rating that it\'s got saw this brilliant piece of art as more of a suspense thriller.But I loved this movie as a delightfully ENTERTAINING, MYSTERIOUS, DRAMA !\r\n\r\nI rate this 10 just because I haven\'t seen any other CLASSIC courtroom drama that was intense throughout(barring some light hearted scenes with Sir Wilfrid Robarts) and yet in the end I somehow felt light-hearted and had a smile on my face rather than a thought provoking look on it.\r\n\r\nThe commentary in the ending credits was innocently adorable for our times of social networking _""The management of this theater suggests that for the greater entertainment of your friends who have not yet seen the picture you will not divulge to anyone the secret of the ending of Witness for the Prosecution!""_\r\n\r\nAnd mind you I am a _big fan of 12 Angry Men and How to Kill a Mockingbird!_ But this movie too is equally good in a different way altogether!', 'I\'m constantly surprised that women\'s hats don\'t provoke more murders.\r\n\r\nLeonard Steven Vole finds himself on trial for the murder of a wealthy widow from whom he has inherited a fortune. Top barrister Sir Wilfrid Robarts takes up the defendants case, but he, along with everyone else, is stunned when Vole\'s seemingly loving wife Christine turns up to testify against the defendant.\r\n\r\nBased on Agatha Christie\'s successful 1953 play, ""Witness For The Prosecution"" benefited from fine tuning from master director Billy Wilder and writing partner Harry Kurnitz. Here the dialogue becomes razor sharp and the characters are fully realised with quite wonderful results, but chiefly the masterstroke here is not letting a court room drama become just that, a court room drama. The film plays out with no wasted scenes, no moments of boredom, and it has such vim and vigour you sometimes forget that there actually is drama in the story.\r\n\r\nThe cast here are on fine form, Wilder had wanted to work with Charles Laughton for some time, and it\'s obvious that both parties here are getting the best out of each other. Laughton is a pure delight as Robarts, a sharp tongue, all bluster and cheeky into the bargain, his interplay with Miss Plimsoll (Laughton\'s real life wife Elsa Lanchester) is quality, and it\'s another testament to Wilder\'s genius for putting them together. Tyrone Power, in what would be his last completed film before sadly passing away, is devilishly smart as Vole, whilst Torin Thatcher is great as the gruff prosecution barrister Myers. Yet as good as they all are, they all sit in the shadow of Marlene Dietrich and her turn as Christine Vole, sultry and femme fatalistic, it\'s a sizzling performance that crowns this delightful film.\r\n\r\nIt occurred to me overnight that it\'s probably the closest film that Wilder got to being Hitchcockian, and I\'m pretty sure the big master of suspense himself would have enjoyed this one. It\'s a mystery that is dramatic, it\'s a thriller that is also funny, it\'s pretty much a multi genre classic. 9/10', 'I might be asking for trouble here, but did Charles Laughton ever actually make a bad film? He leads this one as the brilliant but curmudgeonly barrister ""Sir Wildred Robarts"" with oodles of charisma and style. Marlene Dietrich portrays the evil, manipulative ""Christine Vole"" marvellously and even Tyrone Power, more the matinée idol than the serious actor, delivers as required in Billy Wilder\'s outstanding rendition of the Agatha Christie story about a man accused of murdering an elderly lady who has just happened to leave him a great deal of money in her will. Elsa Lanchester is suitably annoying/scary/lovable as the nurse trying to keep her ailing charge from keeling over mid-trial and a slew of other capable British actors - including a wonderfully charismatic turn from Una O\'Connor in the witness box -  fill in the supporting roles well. It is one of those very rare occasions where everything just gels perfectly and it really is fun to watch. Some of Laughton\'s wry asides and put-down lines are genuinely laugh out loud too. Had it not come up against ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" then I\'m sure it would have garnered at least one Oscar!']"

To be honest, I found the underlying tale of loyalty and family to be just a bit overly-sentimental at times, but the quality and vivacity of the animation is a class apart - huge great eyes and smiles that tell the story so much better than words ever could. The story marries the musical with the dastardly and mysterious nicely with a well written script and a quickly paced storyline that is really quite entertaining. This works better on a big screen - it really shows the animators art off to best effect and, luckily, this has plenty for the adult audience too with some engagingly quirky characters.']"

I was sold by the whole vibe of it from the very beginning, sometimes you can just tell you're going to absolutely enjoy something from the opening minutes and this, for me, was one of those films.\r\n\r\nThe casting is terrific, many well known faces appear. Hugh Jackman, Michael Caine (how about that speech), Christian Bale and Scarlett Johansson are all brilliant, the latter two do hold minimally iffy accents though; or maybe it was just me. There are a few other strong performers too, like Andy Serkis and David Bowie! No-one onscreen puts a foot wrong.\r\n\r\nChristopher Nolan is again back to his twisty best with this one. It's admittedly nothing as super deep as, say, <em>'Inception'</em> and I did read where this one was going in certain aspects, though certainly not every angle - either way, it's just as thrilling to watch no matter how much or how little you pick up. Big fan of the way the film depicts its events throughout.\r\n\r\nJust now seeing how highly this is regarded, on Letterboxd at least. I know I do try to avoid as much as I can with movies, but based on the aforementioned I'm kinda shocked I hadn't heard anything about this growing up or even in recent years.

We start with Christian Bale (""Borden"") about to swing for the murder of Hugh Jackman (""Angier"") but of course it is not that simple; and through a series of complex flashbacks we discover just how these two, erstwhile friends and colleagues, got themselves into this predicament. This is a story about ambition, obsession - to succeed and to hate; it has elements of love - both men have relationships, one the cause of their estrangement; the other (with Scarlett Johansson) continues to fuel it. The whole nature of their profession - illusionists; conjurers of/to the imagination - lends itself splendidly to the subject of this vendetta. The look of the film is first class, with Wally Pfister creating a gem of vivid imagery with some wonderful visual effects too. The performances are OK - they are not great; the dialogue is likewise. For a film essentially about seeing being believing (or not) the script is frequently too wordy and overpowers the subtle opportunities for the actors to demonstrate rather than speak their parts. Sir Michael Caine probably brings the most authentic accent to the proceedings - the others left me needing quite a bit of convincing; and the brief appearances of David Bowie as Tesla were a poor choice of casting, I felt. This is a good film, and I enjoyed it - but I did need to watch it 4 times before I felt half way comfortable writing anything down about it!']"

And that title is ""The Imperial March"", composed by the great John Williams, whom, as many of you may already know, also composed the theme music for ""Jaws"" - that legendary score simply titled, ""Main Title (Theme From Jaws)"".\r\n\r\nNow, with that lil\' bit of trivia aside, let us procede with the fabled film currently under review: Star Wars. It had been at a drive-in theater in some small Illinois town or other where my mother, my older brother, and I had spent our weekly ""Movie Date Night"" watching this George Lucas directed cult masterpiece from our car in the parking lot. On the huge outdoor screen, the film appeared to be a silent one, but thanks to an old wire-attached speaker, we were able to hear both the character dialogue and soundtrack loud and clear. We even had ourselves a carful of vittles and snacks - walked back to our vehicle, of course, from the wide-opened cinema\'s briefly distant concession stand. Indeed, it had been a lovely summer evening that July.\r\n\r\nFrom the time the film started, with my brother and I following along as our mother sped-read the opening crawl, I began to feel rather antsy, thinking that this movie, the first in a franchise that would soon be world-renowned, was going to be boring, due to its genre being Science Fiction: A respectably likable, but not a passionately lovable genre of mine DURING THAT TIME. I just didn\'t believe I was going to like Star Wars all that much ... But I soon found myself intrigued ... And awed.\r\n\r\nGeorge Lucas is a man with a phenomenal, and I do mean phenomenal imagination. Apart from his human characters (Han, Luke, Leia, and Obi-Wan Kenobi, among others), the droids: C-3P0, R2-D2, R2-series, and IG-88, not to mention those unusual characters like Jabba the Hutt, Yoda, and Chewbacca, just to name a few, are all creations of Lucas\'s phenomenal imagination. And I was completely in awe of each one of these strange beings. Then there was Vader ... And the evil Emperor ... And the Stormtroopers ... And the Spacecraft ... And the galaxies (I\'ll admit that I am a huge lover of the Universe in all its Celestial glory) ... And the magnificent planets ... The Lightsabers ... And so on. Star Wars is a gorgeously shot space opera; it is truly an epic masterpiece. We enjoyed this film tremendously. And my brother was a die-hard fan from that night onward. He, my brother, had even received for Christmas that year, nearly every Star Wars action figure that my mother could find, including two of the spacecraft: The Millennium Falcon and Star Destroyer. The Death Star space station had too been wrapped beneath our Christmas tree - tagged with his name. It was totally crazy, what the new Star Wars era. Frenzied! But it was great ... Even still, to this day.\r\n\r\nI don\'t personally know anyone whom has yet to see Star Wars, but that certainly doesn\'t suggest there are still a few people out there who haven\'t. And if you\'re one of the latter, then you should know that this classic space opera comes highly recommended. The entire series is told backwards, so you\'ll definitely want to see Star Wars first, followed by its two sequels: The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi ... In that order. I trust that you\'ll too discover yourself to be a lifelong cult fan in the wake. 😊', 'A long time ago in a childhood not too far away...\r\n\r\nPrincess Leia is captured and held hostage by the Imperial Army as it seeks to rule the Galactic Empire. An old Jedi Knight by the name of Ben ""Obi-Wan"" Kenobi may just be hers, and the rebels only hope. Teaming up with farm boy Luke Skywalker, scoundrel Captain Han Solo, and a couple of quirky droids, Kenobi sets off on a mission that could well shape the destiny of the Galaxy, and all who dwell within it.\r\n\r\nBack in 1977 I was but a wee 11 year old boy, weened on films from all genres by my movie loving parents, I had no idea that Star Wars was to have the same impact on me as Jaws had two summers previously, where yet again I found myself queueing around the block for two whole hours to see a film in a one screen theatre. My love of cinema firmly cemented, Star Wars was the start of a love affair that lasts to this very day.\r\n\r\nAs the years have rolled by and my love of cinema has taken on more in-depth and serious tones, I have come to realise that Star Wars proves to be a far from flawless picture. Certainly its detractors do point to some frayed acting and call the plot structure a jazzed up good versus evil axis, while the charge of George Lucas referencing many prior pictures most assuredly stands, but really do those things matter? No they do not, because Star Wars opened up a new world of cinema, something of a portal to youngsters such as I, it got people talking and debating about the merits of model work in films (which is of an extraordinary high standard here), it nudged film makers to explore being bigger and bolder in their approach, and crucially, above all else, it got film goers hungry again, a hankering for more please if you may. Now it has to be said that all that followed 20th Century Fox\'s historic blockbuster didn\'t run with the baton, in fact most pale into comparison on impact value, but for better or worse (depending on the discerning viewers peccadilloes), Star Wars stands as a bastion of adventure laden entertainment.\r\n\r\nIt is by definition one of the most successful films in history, George Lucas perhaps didn\'t know it at the time, but in what was to become an almost operatic anthology, he didn\'t just make a movie, he created a whole new world seeping with style and rich texture. Almost as amazing as the success of the series, is how it has become part of modern day pop culture, anything from religion to everyday speak has at some time or another referenced Lucas\' baby. Ultimately, though, it\'s one single thing that made (and still does make) Star Wars so great, it\'s that it has the ability to lift the audience into a rousing united feel good cheer; and that is something that few films can ever lay claim too. In 1977 it was an awe inspiring event to watch in the theatre, now here in my middle age it\'s an event that is like hugging a dear old friend, a friend that I know will never ever let me down no matter how many times I turn to it. 10/10', 'Star Wars (1977) is a true masterpiece of cinema, and is \r\n  definitely one of the best films ever made.\r\n\r\nFor me Star Wars (1977) is the best movie of all time,tied with The Lord of the Rings trilogy. Star Wars (1977) it is for sure the most iconic film of all time everything in it is iconic. The direction, the script, the performances in this film are brilliant, all the characters are captivating and well developed. \r\n\r\nAnyway, this is a totally perfect film, I only have praise for it, it is certainly a masterpiece of cinema, and my grade for it is 10\\10.', ""A quality start to the franchise.\r\n\r\nI say start, I guess that depends on the (seemingly) controversial way of watching these films - I've decided on release order, so it's the beginning for me anyway. I've heard a lot about <em>'Star Wars'</em> so I am expecting big things, this didn't disappoint whatsoever.\r\n\r\nI unquestionably enjoyed this! If I didn't know this was released in 1977 I would never have guessed, it still holds up astonishingly well. The special effects are spectacular for the vast, vast majority; even the stuff that perhaps hasn't aged as supremely still looks superb.\r\n\r\nThe cast are a joy. I actually wouldn't say any performance sensationally stood out, but all the actors and all the characters are so much fun to watch together. Mark Hamill is impressive as Luke, Harrison Ford is entertaining as Han and Carrie Fisher is super as Leia. Credit also to James Earl Jones and Alec Guinness, among others. Despite not watching until now, I literally already knew all of the character names - shows how timeless these are.\r\n\r\nThe plot makes for top notch viewing, I found the pacing to be particularly spot on. And how about that score? Stupendous! I really have no negatives for this, I'm sure it isn't perfect but I had a very fun time with it."", ""Everyone and their mother is going to write reviews about the Star Wars movies...and this one, this one actually came out before I was born.\r\n\r\nIt breaks the heart. I had to wait until the re-release before I got to see this one on the big screen. This is the one that ruined my Star Wars opening night streak...\r\n\r\n...Well The Force Awakens ALMOST ruined it further. I had to drive out to my parents house just to see it, for the sake of tradition, and when I got there they had already gone without me...twice.\r\n\r\nSome angry words later and I guilted my mom, pointing out the drive, to force her into a third go.\r\n\r\nBut that is neither here nor there.\r\n\r\nThis was the movie that started it all. And the first time I saw it, it was on Beta. Once upon a time my family had the movie in Beta. And then I had the trilogy in VHS. And then I had it on DVD. And it is going to repeat like that as the mediums change.\r\n\r\nIts one of those movies that you have to own, even as technology changes. It is actually one of those movies you want to buy right away when the technology changes, just to see it in better and better quality.\r\n\r\nThat should be saying something right there. But for a lot of you its not.\r\n\r\nFor the rest of you, it is a fairy tale in space, complete with knights and old wizards and a princess. Only its a fairy tale in space made for, well, made for nerds like me.\r\n\r\nIt is a legend and the type of legend that stays with people and makes old Gen-Xers like me, cynical and grumpy, feel like little kids again.\r\n\r\nIt, along with the Godfather, is the type of movie that breeds mental spousal abuse as generations of men force their wives at gunpoint to watch them...and then get confused and a little depressed when most of them don't see the fascination with them.\r\n\r\nUnlike the Godfather, however, its the movie that fathers force their children to watch and, then, their children carry the love for it into the next generation.\r\n\r\nStar Wars is an endless cycle, even the bad ones are good. And the fans create endless theories about them. They buy the t-shirts, the buy the toys, they do everything they can to preserve that love and pass it on.\r\n\r\nA New Hope, this is the film that started all of that, and though there are better installments, this will always be the first."", 'Thinking back to the films that define my generation; I recall queuing round the cinema as an excited 10 year old for two hours waiting to see this film. I wonder how many people could say that they have done that in the last 20 years? This film is a truly groundbreaking piece of formative cinema. Leaving aside the magnificent special effects; this is a film about good and evil; empire, freedom and democracy and of their true characterisations. It has a slightly stilted script (particularly from Sir Alec Guinness) but that is more than offset by a fabulous John Williams\' score and the hugely engaging performances of Hamill, Fisher and Ford with undoubtedly the best baddie cinema has ever seen in ""Darth Vader"". Truly a wonderful watch.']"

Yum Yum Yum!\r\n\r\n\r\nI rate this movie as A. Love the story. Love the actor.', 'Mind-tripping psychological-thriller from Martin Scorsese, a bit of a change-up for him, with great performances all around of course including DiCaprio and Kingsley. This was my first viewing as I had procrastinated watching this for whatever reason, but found it highly entertaining with amazing, foreboding atmosphere. **4.5/5**', 'Don\'t you get it? You\'re a rat in a maze.\r\n\r\nUS Marshal Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) travels to an island asylum facility for the criminally insane with his newly assigned partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo). Their reason for being at Ashecliff Hospital is to investigate the mysterious disappearance of murderess Rachel Solando. But Teddy has another issue to deal with at Ashecliff, namely a meeting with Andrew Laeddis (Elias Koteas), the man he believes responsible for the death of his wife (Michelle Williams). Nothing is what it seems at the facility though, and the further Teddy & Chuck investigate, the murkier the truths of Ashecliff become.\r\n\r\nDirected by Martin Scorsese, Shutter Island is adapted from the best selling novel of the same name written by Dennis Lehane (""Mystic River/Gone Baby Gone""). It finds the talented director getting closer to horror than at any point in his career, it also finds him arguably over cooking his grits. Lehane\'s novel is a page turning lesson in thriller writing, there\'s no need for deep cranial thinking or fill in the blanks like musings. Scorsese has crafted a movie that, whilst both stylish and moody, is far more intricate than it needed to be. \r\n\r\nFrom the off we saw reams of amateur reviewers dissecting the film and searching for other worldly cinematic meanings. The truth is, is that they don\'t exist, it is just a great story pinging with psychological twisters. Lehane himself said he felt it was a book he kind of knocked out while in his flow (he undersells himself mind). Scorsese, clearly loving the source to be sure, has crammed too much in for the film to be an across the board winner. Technically accomplished? Without doubt. Depth to the story? You bet. But the reality is that the depth isn\'t enough to sustain all the genre blending atmospherics that is Marty\'s want. One is inclined to feel that he so aware that he is treading on well worn genre ground (spot the homages to film noir, old time horror and Hitchcockian grandeur), that he\'s trying to steer the viewers away from the obviousness on offer. The film is further let down by the second half, where it positively crawls along, something not helped by the fact that the first hour bristles with moody excitement and a promise of clinically executed terror. Anticipation can be a real killer at times...\r\n\r\nYet as is normally the way with a professionally assembled Scorsese picture, there\'s still so much to enjoy and moments that ensure it will always be a divisive film in the New Yorker\'s cannon. The cast are mostly great, DiCaprio delivers a stunning performance, one that can only be appreciated once the story has reached the climax. Ruffalo (restrained), Ben Kingsley (shifty) & Max Von Sydow (troubling) all do what is needed and in keeping with the tone of the piece. While the girls - Emily Mortimer, Patricia Clarkson & Williams - have small but crucial parts to play. \r\n\r\nThen there\'s the supporting characters played by some quality character actors. Koteas is joined by Jackie Earle Haley, Ted Levein & John Carroll Lynch. How many of you noticed that we here have a roll call of cinematic serial killers? Edgar Reese, Freddy Krueger, Buffalo Bill and Arthur Lee Allen! (OK, Allen was not proved but ""Zodiac"" the movie lends us to believe it was him). The music used is suitably heart pounding and Robert Richardson\'s photography is on the money, especially within the dimly lit Ashecliff walls (the foreboding Medfield State Hospital for location filming). The costumes also have a nice 50s look to them, our first encounter of Teddy & Chuck sees them splendidly adorned in film noir hats and coats. While Thelma Schoonmaker\'s editing is up to the usual tight standard.\r\n\r\nIt\'s always tricky when great directors are involved, so unsurprisingly we witnessed at the start a difference of opinion with the critics as to how good Shutter Island is? What most agreed on was that the film fluctuates in quality and should have been, given the talent behind and in front of the camera, a much better picture. There\'s also no getting away from the fact that if you have read the book first the impact of the ending is considerably weakened. Personally I feel Scorsese was the wrong director for this particular source, but that\'s me, and be that as it may, he still manages to come out of it in credit with his fans - though even if he just passed gas some of them would proclaim it as a masterpiece... 7.5/10', 'A US federal Marshal is sent on to investigate a missing patient on an isolated asylum called The Shutter Island. What he’s about to uncover will question him and his true identity. Quite exclusive and one of those storyline where you can’t lose your concentration for even a minute. Paradox plot, loved it through and through. This is pretty unusual but loved the soundtracks in the background helping in the foundation of suspense. Definitely another Scorsese masterpiece. A must watch.\r\n\r\nFollow us on Instagram: @flixxflyy', 'Good suspense and mystery, although a bit too reliant on hallucinations, and the ending could have been better.', 'Accompanied by a great cast and atmosphere, ‘Shutter Island’ certainly has a thrilling and engaging mystery to unfold, with an ending that is as tranquil as bittersweet.\r\n\r\n8/10', '**_Leonardo DiCaprio’s trip to Fantasy Island_**\r\n\r\nIn 1954, two US Marshals (DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo) are sent to an island off the coast of Massachusetts to investigate the disappearance of a patient from the asylum for the criminally insane located there. The lead detective suspects something really fishy going on.\r\n\r\n""Shutter Island"" (2010) is like a combination of “The Shawshank Redemption” and “A Beautiful Mind” with a little “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest.” Being helmed by Scorsese, it’s a top-notch production with a stellar cast, including the likes of Ben Kingsley, Max von Sydow, Michelle Williams, Patricia Clarkson and Jackie Earle Haley.\r\n\r\nThe first three quarters are quite good as a slow-burn eerie investigation with the milieu of post-WW2 America and interesting flashbacks to Dachau Concentration Camp. Unfortunately, the last quarter ruins the movie for me. Don’t get me wrong, the ‘twist’ could’ve been done in a compelling, streamlined way, such as in “The Sixth Sense,” but instead everything’s unnecessarily drawn out. For instance, the final sequence between DiCaprio and Michelle Williams is dreadfully dull.\r\n\r\nStill, it’s a matter of taste. So, if what I described above intrigues you, give it a watch. Many cinephiles hail it.\r\n\r\nFittingly, the title, “Shutter Island,” is an anagram of ""truths and lies"" or ""truths/denials.”\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hour, 18 minutes, and was shot mostly in Massachusetts, but some stuff in Los Angeles and northeast of there at Hearst Ranch, San Simeon.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-', 'Shutter Island deserves all the praise for being one of those films that stays with you long after the credits roll. Martin Scorsese dives into the psychological thriller genre with precision, creating an atmosphere that’s equal parts eerie and thought-provoking.\r\n\r\nLeonardo DiCaprio absolutely nails it as Teddy Daniels, a U.S. Marshal investigating the disappearance of a patient from Ashecliffe Hospital. His performance is raw, vulnerable, and perfectly captures the gradual unraveling of Teddy’s psyche. Mark Ruffalo as his partner Chuck adds a subtle balance to the chaos, making their partnership intriguing to watch. And let’s not forget Ben Kingsley, his calm, enigmatic portrayal of Dr. Cawley gives the film its chilling edge.\r\n\r\nVisually, the movie is a masterpiece. The cinematography by Robert Richardson is hauntingly beautiful, capturing the oppressive isolation of the island and the labyrinthine corridors of the asylum. The storm scenes are particularly memorable, heightening the tension and pulling you deeper into the mystery. And that score, Scorsese’s choice of music hits all the right notes to amplify the unease and suspense.\r\n\r\nWhat sets Shutter Island apart, though, is the narrative.

Went to an afternoon screening and it was packed. From the very first scene to the last , I was in awe. This is the best movie I have seen in a long time. The last 30 minutes of the film, I had tears rolling down my cheeks. After it ended, it got a 5 minute standing ovation. Braveheart is my all time favourite movie and have seen it over 200 times., but this might just be my new favourite movie. I have seen it 6 times now, and cried every time. It is such an emotional film. The story of the HERO Desmond Doss is truly inspiring.Thank you Mel Gibson and Desmond Doss Jr. for letting us know more about this remarkable man. Hugo Weaving was robbed of an Oscar nomination. Andrew Garfield blew my away with his performance and it is Vince Vaughn's best performance as well. It is the best film of 2016."", ""**On the battlefront, his intention was to save the lives.**\r\n\r\nThe film was awesome, mainly because of the good message it carried out. That's not it, the film was well made with the wonderful cast and their great performances. The special effects were top notch, as well as the location where the majority of the second half takes place. This is a US-Australian co-production. Mel Gibson returned to the director's chair with a bang after exactly a decade. It got six Oscars nominees, so let's wait and see how many awards it grabs.\r\n\r\nIt was the World War II theme, based on a real person and events. It tells the story of an American youngster named Desmond Doss, who joins the army to contribute to his nation. But for his religious point of view, he struggles during the training. After managing to make through, the remaining film focused to reveal his bravery on the battlefield against the Japanese armed forces at Okinawa in a place called Hacsaw Ridge.\r\n\r\nThe story was based on one of the ten commandments. Doss, who strongly believes in that carries the same ideology to the combat zone. But all the initial part of the film reflects why he is very on to it. Especially after a fight with his brother in his childhood, followed by saving a severely injured man in a road accident just before deciding to join the army. So it is like both, a war film, as well as an anti-war theme. Most importantly, it tells us the bravery of a man, like of something Gandhi in the battlefield.\r\n\r\nHe did it in what he had believed, but my perspective differs. I liked the film, as a biopic and the message it delivered. Very entertaining too, but when it comes to Doss' belief, I think it was flawed. In the first place he would have not joined the army if he's true to the commandment. That's the basic rule of the commandment if one wants to adopt it.\r\n\r\nHe was just one of the unique person with such idea and luckily succeeded following it in a hostile situation. Only if you think all his episodes from an atheist perspective, that's how you would feel. One of the major reasons for that is, when he saves his men by letting his enemy die. But appreciable effort, at least from the Americans perspective. A true hero for his nation. One of the best war films ever. Instead of saying a must see film, I would say don't miss it.\r\n\r\n_7.5/10_"", ""Most of these men don't believe the same way you do, but they believe so much in how much you believe. \r\n\r\nHacksaw Ridge is directed by Mel Gibson and written by Robert Schenkkan and Andrew Knight. It is based on the 2004 documentary The Conscientious Objector. It stars Andrew Garfield, Sam Worthington, Vince Vaughn, Luke Bracey, Teresa Palmer, Ryan Corr, Hugo Weaving and Rachel Griffiths. Music is by Rupert Gregson-Williams and cinematography by Simon Duggan.\r\n\r\nFilm is a depiction of the real life heroics of Desmond Doss, an American pacifist combat medic in WWII during The Battle of Okinawa.\r\n\r\nHow great to have Gibson back directing, more so when he's tackling the brutalities of war and the critical human interest stories within. The story of Desmond Doss is inspirational stuff and Gibson and his team have done his story proud. \r\n\r\nFirst half of the picture details Doss' upbringing, getting to know his family background, his beliefs and the forming of his loving relationship with Dorothy Schutte. Then after Pearl Harbour he enlists in service and we are then witness to boot camp, which comes with the horrors of bullying and ostracization due to Doss refusing to even touch a rifle - let alone use one! After the military based political thunder has exhausted its armoury, Doss and the rest of the 77th Infantry Division are sent to Okinawa to try and capture the Maeda Escarpment (Hacksaw Ridge). From where a true legend is born.\r\n\r\nAs is a Gibson trademark, the battle scenes are terrifyingly real and bloody as can be, the horrors of war laid bare for dramatic impact. Amongst the carnage, which is magnificently framed in smoky hazes and a landscape obliterated by weaponry, Doss (brilliantly brought to life by Garfield) comes to the fore. From within the madness comes humanity in its purest and most genuine form, and it makes for edge of the seat viewing whilst stirring the blood of those invested fully in this remarkable story. 9/10"", '***Tribute to a real-life WW2 “conscientious collaborator”*** \r\n\r\nAfter Pearl Harbor, Desmond Doss of Lynchburg, Virginia, joins the US Army to become a medic and serves at the Battle of Okinawa. As a Seventh Day Adventist and conscientious objector, his goal was to save lives, not kill, which naturally causes problems with his fellow soldiers; until they observe his bravery in combat. Teresa Palmer is on hand as Doss’ potential babe while Vince Vaughn plays the drill sergeant. \r\n\r\nBased on a true story and directed by Mel Gibson, ""Hacksaw Ridge"" (2016) is a reverent and compelling WW2 flick that includes the usual training sequences in the first half balanced by intense combat sequences in the second. The unique factor here is that the brave protagonist refuses to use a weapon and is determined to only save lives in the midst of the insanity of war. This is an interesting real-life tale that needs to be told and “Hacksaw Ridge” is a good war movie only marred by laying on the heroics too thick as well as the lack of depth in the peripheral characters, which makes them uninteresting. The latter is in contrast to the outstanding “Platoon” (1986) which featured several well-defined characters.\r\n\r\nThe movie’s about an individual who believes in ABSOLUTE pacifism, which is a peaceable attitude that refuses to ever turn to violence, even in response to evil or for the purpose of national defense. He thinks this is supported by the Bible and, specifically, the New Testament, but it isn’t. The Scriptures support LIMITED pacifism, which is a peaceable attitude that only resorts to violence when justified. Christ\' instructions to ""turn the cheek"" related to responding to a backhanded slap to the face, which was an insult in that culture. In other words, we could all save ourselves a lot of trouble in life if we learn to ignore the antagonism of various morons who would like to divert our focus and ruin our day. The Old Testament teaches this as well: ""A fool shows his annoyance at once, but a prudent man overlooks an insult"" (Proverbs 12:16). So Christ was talking about giving an antagonist a break for the sake of peace in situations of personal offense; he wasn\'t referring to cases of severe criminal acts or defense of one’s nation. \r\n\r\nFor proof, Jesus\' ministry team had a treasury box and some of his workers carried swords for protection from thieves/murderers in their travels. You see, Christ & his disciples weren’t absolute pacifists. On two occasions, the Messiah got a whip out and chased all the fools out of the Temple – throwing over tables, swinging the whip and yelling. He was a Holy Terror, pure & simple, and this caused the legalistic religious leaders to fear him and plot murder (Mark 11:15-18). Harmless pacifists don\'t inspire fear and provoke murder plots. Moreover, Romans 13 clearly states that the righteous laws of human governments are ordained of God for the purpose of punishing criminals, domestic & foreign, who threaten the lives of citizens. This includes the right to execute when appropriate. The majority of sane Christians realize this, but there are a few extremists, like Doss in the movie, who refuse to be balanced with the Scriptures on this matter and insist that violent conflict is never appropriate. They’re wrong. Sometimes it’s necessary, like after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, unprovoked, murdering over 2300 innocents and wounding 1100.\r\n\r\nThe film runs 2 hour, 19 minutes, and was shot in New South Wales, Australia.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B-', ""**A really good movie, which only lacks in some details.**\r\n\r\nThis was not the first war film directed by Mel Gibson. He had previously made at least one military-themed film, “We Were Soldiers”, set in Vietnam. However, it is a film that addresses much more human and intimate themes, in my opinion, by following the Doss family, a family from rural Virginia, and the trajectory of one of their children, Desmond.\r\n\r\nSon of an extraordinarily devout mother, raised an Adventist, Desmond learns as a child to deny violence (the film shows a fight between brothers that could have ended very badly, but in real life it was a fight between Desmond's father and his brother-in-law) and to strictly follow his faith and religion. When the US joins the Allies in World War II, the brothers decide to enlist, but Desmond insists on doing so on his own terms, that is, as a combat rescuer, exempt from the use and carrying of any weapon. Of course, the US military isn't going to take this in the best light.\r\n\r\nThe film exposes itself in a somewhat lengthy way and captures our sympathy very well, but despite many people complaining that the first part of the film is slow and tiring, I felt this more in the prolonged combat scenes, despite understanding what led Gibson to detail them so exhaustively. Still, it is necessary to be frank: they are excellent battle scenes, with rich details and a very accentuated degree of rawness. Unfortunately, the dialogues aren't very good, they sound a bit cliché, and it's annoying to see that in a movie with so many qualities. The film also makes efforts to create a romantic subplot around Desmond's first wife, but things don't go well, and the material is frankly poor.\r\n\r\nIn general, Gibson does a good job of directing, although that won't come as a surprise to the most attentive observer. He already has a number of hits in his filmography and, together with Clint Eastwood and Bradley Cooper, is one of the actors I most like to see in the director's chair. Until now, I never really considered the value of the actors involved in this project. Some I just don't know very well. Andrew Garfield is an example: I've seen him in other works, but the actor never completely convinced me, so I was very impressed with his work here. Sam Worthington also impressed me very well, although he's an actor I recognize more easily, and I've seen him work well in other films. Hugo Weaving is excellent, and Vince Vaughn also deserves praise. Only Teresa Palmer seems to have more difficulty to disentangling herself from the work at hand, perhaps due to the weak material received.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film has a lot of good things to look at, starting with the reasonably rigorous way in which Gibson seeks to re-enact the combat and war environment, from the recruiting camp to the field. Unlike many films from his past, where the director trampled on historical truth, he seems to make sincere efforts to respect it here. The visual and special effects are really very good, and the CGI used is truly excellent and gives the film a remarkable realism, especially in the combat scenes. The sets are interesting and the costumes too. I especially liked the old uniform that Weaving wears in a brief scene, given the difference with the uniforms in use at the time. The cinematography takes advantage of all this and more, and the camera moves intelligently, putting us in the fight, making us suffer with those soldiers, and feel what they felt, what Gregson's soundtrack -Williams accentuates even more."", ""I don't want to say that I dislike Mel Gibson as an actor, I mean he's been in plenty of movies that I love... but like Clint Eastwood, he makes a FAR better director than he ever made an actor.\r\n\r\nHacksaw Ridge is just one of those films where he does a great job... unfortunately it is Mel Gibson, so it's over-the-top carnage that is not at all underplayed. But you can't fault Gibson for making a Gibson film, you should really know as much coming in.\r\n\r\nAnd he actually got Andre Garfield to act, which might not win him a reward, but it certainly should, that is a something that could get a man canonized... and it was his involvement that made me mistakenly put off viewing it for a few years. He seems like a real actor in this, accent and all.\r\n\r\nAnd then, of course, it's the story of a pacifist who went to war to save lives... and in the end that's pretty noble by the strictest definition and you feel it though out, which is probably the point... despite the over-the-top carnage.""]"

Yes - it was worth the wait. The film is all about some truly exhilarating aerial photography that culminates in some super dogfighting and a good old dose of nostalgia. Tom Cruise is very much in his element as the ageing - and frequently not afraid to look it - eponymous ""Top Gun"" pilot drafted in by a rather sceptical admiral to train up a new squad for a very perilous mission to destroy an underground uranium enrichment facility. The team arrive - full of hormones - and he must whip them into shape, a task made more difficult by the presence of ""Rooster"" (Miles Teller) who is the son of his old mate ""Goose"" who came to a sticky end last time out in 1986. He also gets to rekindle his romance with bar owner ""Penny"" (Jennifer Connelly) whilst all under the protection of his former wingman, now the poorly retired admiral ""Kazansky"" (Val Kilmer). To be honest, the story isn\'t really up to much - there are some twists and turns, the script is not without some humour but there is no jeopardy really. We all know what is going to happen in the end. That said, though, everyone is on good form; the pace (aside from the interludes with Connelly which do rather abruptly slow things down a bit) is consistently action packed and the imagery from both inside and outside of these amazing pieces of machinery is not at all repetitive and is compelling to watch. Even the usual gung-ho, ye-ha stuff is kept to a minimum - this is a superior film depicting the US military at it\'s most competitive, but also at it\'s most intelligent - and I really quite enjoyed it. Big screen photography - don\'t wait til it is on the telly.', '_Top Gun: Maverick_ is a sequel that is a leaps and bounds improvement over the original film. There’s better acting from the entire cast, more of an emotional attachment between at least two of the main characters in the film, and subtle humor that actually lands.

Trust me, you\'ll never regret it.**', 'This was a good movie. It has a pretty generic story, but its filled with a lot of heart and the right music at the right times.

Impactful stuff.\r\n\r\nLooks great, sounds great, feels great. Loved it."", 'nice movie', ""Really solid action-thriller with amazing stunts and pulls on the heartstrings without feeling forced. Tom Cruise is great as usual and Miles Teller was fine though didn't feel like he had enough time to shine, but his scenes with Cruise were good. Jennifer Connelly has aged really well and they did nice service for Val Kilmer's Iceman. Really solid, entertaining old fashioned blockbuster. **4.25/5**"", 'Top Gun: Maverick had a ton of praise when I finally got around to watching it and it did a relatively good job living up to it.\r\n\r\nMy main two complaints from the original have been entirely corrected in it\'s sequel: cheesy dialogue and terrible shot selection in the aerial sequences. The script has been vastly improved upon with updated dialogue just all around better acting than the original. There were not corny lines or interactions that felt awkward. The aerial combat sections are incredible, they are done with such precision and purpose. I could actually understand what was on and where the fighter crafts were in relation to each. These raised the stacks and hade me fully invested.\r\n\r\nThe overall story is pretty great. I loved how the recruits were training for a final ""suicide"" mission, instead of just graduating from the academy. The dynamics between Tom Cruise and his superiors/students were great and felt witty and genuine. The continued relationship with Iceman was touching as they seem to have a real connection that has lasted throughout the years, although I thought his illness and they way they presented it was a bit out of place. My one big complain his Cruises love interest. This plot really has no impact on the story and is just thrown in there for old time sakes. I did enjoy their chemistry together and it was cute to his interactions with daughter. But, I watched the original directly before this and was utterly confused on who she was. It was really odd to have a throw away line in the original be the main love interest in the sequel, but like I said, it did not have a huge impact.\r\n\r\nThe performances are spectacular in this film. Tom Cruise and Miles Teller are standouts and their back and forth is really fun to see, delivering some funny jabs but some series dramatic moments. Jon Hamm was great as a hard ass commanding officer. Glen Powell was a standout as well, his cockiness and rivalry with Rooster was great but complex.\r\n\r\nThis film is a blast, and I really wish I would have made the time to see it in theaters. I really enjoyed this and I am definitely not one who fancies these types of films, but it captured me.\r\n\r\nScore: 87%\r\nVerdict: Excellent', ""You're not supposed to like this, very literally.  IMDb will block your reviews of this movie if you praise it.  Amazon (owned by the same company) is fudging the like ratio, and Youtube did the same with the trailer.\r\n\r\nThat makes sense.  It really does.\r\n\r\nMaverick is a patriotic action movie with a male lead that doesn't make the male lead look like an idiot.  The white guy isn't evil.  America isn't evil.  It's a sequel that doesn't trash the heroes of the first film or attack the fans.\r\n\r\nFrom start to finish it's just a solid apolitical action movie.\r\n\r\nSo of course you are supposed to hate it, it literally breaks all the rules of modern Hollywood.\r\n\r\nAnd that was why it was the biggest blockbuster of the past few years.  That is why it had returns that would be a mega-bock buster pre-COVID.  It's the type of movie that people actually want to see, which is why it's under attack on certain sites.  You're not supposed to know that people like it and they weren't supposed to make a movie that people wanted to see.\r\n\r\nEverything has to be a propaganda piece.  \r\n\r\nBut you want to know a secret?  If this came out in the 80s it wouldn't have done well.  It's not as good of an action movie as they had back then.  It actually sort of sucks compared to a lot of the classic action movies of this genre.\r\n\r\nBut then it came out in 2022 and the rules have all changed.  Today everything is racist or far left.  So what you have here is a movie that is great... by 2022 standards... simply because it's not the crap that Hollywood is shoving down your throats and demanding that you like."", 'For me this movie was a letdown. Having watched the original Top Gun when it first came out, this version comes nowhere close to that one. Like most movies in the past decade or so, real originality is lacking. Seems like all there are nowadays are rehashes of older stuff. The supporting cast is lackluster at best.\r\nThere is nothing in this movie to get excited about. I suppose if you get drunk and need to sleep it off... go watch this movie.', ""As a teenager, nearly 40 years ago, I was consumed by the original Top Gun. It fueled my dreams of becoming a pilot, and Tom Cruise's charisma, alongside the adrenaline-pumping aerial sequences, left an indelible mark on my youth. When I heard the familiar theme song for Top Gun, goosebumps erupted across my skin.\r\n\r\nWhile I had sky-high expectations, I confess to feeling a tinge of disappointment. After all, it's been nearly two years since the premiere, and the hype had settled. Yet, I found myself glued to the couch, unable to tear my eyes away. Maverick did its job - it satisfied the old fanboys. The producers flawlessly recreated the vibe of the original, masterfully capturing the essence of that 80s era, but with cutting-edge technology and cinematography. The film is a testament to their meticulous attention to detail.\r\n\r\nBut Maverick isn't just about nostalgia. For me, it's a celebration of aviation technology. Seeing the F-18 Super Hornet and the iconic F-14 Tomcat, my childhood fighter jet heroes, soar across the screen alongside newer generation aircraft was a joy for my inner tech enthusiast.\r\n\r\nWhile the technical aspects are captivating, the film transcends the niche. Top Gun: Maverick is a universal experience, packed with heart-stopping action, engaging characters, and a compelling story that resonates with anyone who's ever chased a dream. It may not be the groundbreaking masterpiece that the original was, but it's a thrilling and nostalgic journey that will leave you breathless."", '**A very good sequel, maybe even better than the first ""Top Gun""**\r\n\r\nI enjoyed this movie a lot. It has a straight and simple and yet captivating story and a lot of very good top tier action, and wich was done by using mostly practical effects and filmmaking and was not a CGI overkill, unlike so many blockbuster action movies nowadays.\r\n\r\nThe movie also stands out as an example for a very good sequel, which might even be superior to the first movie.\r\n\r\nIf you can see past the blatant and yet relatively sparingly inserted ""US world police"" prop***anda (which was in the first ""Top Gun"" as well), this movie can be a very fun ride for you, especially if you are into a somewhat conservative action movie experience. Thank you, Tom Cruise, for giving us such a movie in the 2020ies!\r\n\r\nA very good sequel, maybe even better than the first ""Top Gun"".']"

Frankly…**\r\n\r\nI really enjoyed this film, largely thanks to the lightness of its story, and the funny way in which the film plays with the situation in which the protagonist finds himself intertwined. The film was, in fact, the big winner of the Oscars in its year, with ten nominations and five statuettes (Best Editing, Best Art Direction in Black and White, Best Original Screenplay, Best Director and, the icing on the cake, Best movie). However, if we observe that that year were also nominated for much more memorable films such as “Spartacus” or “Psycho”, it is questionable whether this film really deserved to be considered the best film of the year.\r\n\r\nThe script is based on the difficulties experienced by a simple office worker of a large insurance company from the moment he begins to lend his own apartment to several superiors in the firm, so that they can take their mistresses and girlfriends there. With the situation, he gains a bad reputation among the neighbors and with the landlady, in addition to not being able to go to his own house when he wants and thinks he should, being always limited by the arrangements that he is, from a certain moment, coerced into keeping. , as you progress in the firm thanks to the exchange of favors. Of course, there's going to be a very complicated romance midway through the story, and everything will end well, as it does in these comedies.\r\n\r\nThe cast is half the recipe for this success. Jack Lemmon gives us a very good performance, perhaps the best of his career as an actor, along with his enormous acting exercise in “Some Like it Hot”. Fred McMurray was also very good in this film, giving us with commitment and great charisma an unpalatable character (a married man, very important in the company, who betrays his wife and will take advantage of the ambition of a minor employee). Without disapproval for the good performance of Sirley MacLaine, who gave life to a fragile young woman who is the main love interest of the protagonist, the film is not especially sympathetic to any element of the female cast.\r\n\r\nThe film has a very pleasant pace and time passes without us noticing it, if we give the story a chance to get involved. I think the good editing and the fact that the film doesn't stop at dead moments helped a lot at that point. Good sets and costumes, especially the office set, with all the details we can imagine, make for a film that is good, although I can consider that there are far superior films.""]"

Looking back, it's probably the year that I was introduced to the most great literary works of all my life (especially 'Anthem' by Ayn Rand and 'Nausea' by Jean-Paul Sartre). Included that year in the course's curriculum was Anthony Burgess' dystopian masterwork, 'A Clockwork Orange' (as well as George Orwell's 'Animal Farm'--like Frank Sinatra would have said, 'It was a very good year'). I was mesmerized with it from the instant I noticed the unique approach to language, the 'ultraviolence' and of course, the eternal question of free will, its relationship to good-and-evil, and the can of worms of the myriad of ethical dilemmas that comes to the fore of individual freedom and rights versus that of society at large. The genius of Burgess was being able to put so well and forcibly, yet in such an entertaining way, so many issues that, had most anyone else set forth on the endeavor, would have come up with the type of off-putting, heavy-handed sermon that would never have reached such a literary pinnacle, and been required reading even now, generations later. It hasn't aged or dated a day.\r\n\r\nMost cinematic observers felt the book unfilmable. Director Kubrick's adaptations work so well, particularly this, '2001: A Space Odyssey' and 'The Shining' (even though Stephen King would fervently disagree about the latter) because he, as he did with 'Dr. Strangelove', can so easily both find unforgettable visual metaphors for his ideas and so handily combine humour (an under-recognized trait of his, much more readily associated with say, Sir Alfred Hitchcock) with these heavy and daunting philosophical and intellectual volleys. In the wrong hands (particularly a Stanley Kramer, or his ilk), this could have failed miserably, like typical cinematic treatments of Ayn Rand novels. But this worked triumphantly, and heartily exemplifies one of the greatest directors ever at the apex of his craftsmanship. No self-respecting cinephile can avoid this movie, and I heartily recommend you to read the novel as well, though Kubrick nails it so effectively, reading the novel isn't necessary in the slightest for the film to be enjoyed.\r\n\r\nOne of the many 'gamechanger' films of Kubrick's storied and remarkable career."", ""Some great visuals and direction not to mention an incredible performance from Malcolm McDowell, I wasn't totally into this, the first half especially was taxing to get through to the point I stopped watching and only finished a couple days later. The rest was good and found myself a bit more engaged however as a whole, this one never grabbed me. **3.5/5**"", 'With this film, a world heritage of cinema, Stanley Kubrick has reached a level of artistic mastery that would make Michelangelo pale in comparison. To make a film an art form, it must have the innovation of a Chaplin or Jean-Luc Godard. Furthermore, for a film to be a masterpiece, it must have music, direction, and great performances by the cast. Nevertheless, this film easily fulfills these requirements, and miraculously, it is a perfect work of art, with outstandingly high quality visual beauty far above the audience. For 136 minutes, one feels as if one has stepped into an exhibition of paintings or photographs that are sigh-inducingly vivid, beautiful, sometimes violent, and sometimes insane. The film\'s elaborate camerawork is erotic, but not vulgar, like a sensual film. The clarity of vision, both pictorial and photographic, is unparalleled. Any of the scenes, even the still ones, would make a grade-A photo book. Without a doubt, it is the best film made in the entire world in 1971. It deserves to be the ""Pietà"" of the film world.', ""This is a truly challenging film that routinely glorifies violence - especially towards women, and offers us a terrifying appraisal of the effects of unfettered government and science working in cahoots with each other. Fifty years on from it's groundbreaking release, it's great to watch this on a big screen again - and though the imagery is much less potent that it was in 1971, the performance from Malcolm McDowell is scarily compelling. The plot centres around him and his three sadistic cohorts who live a disparate life terrorising wherever they roam until finally they go a little too far and he is apprehended. A fourteen year sentence is handed down but after two of them, he seeks enrolment in a controversial, experimental, aversion therapy scheme the results of which don't quite deliver as expected. The film presents us with some some pretty gruesome worst-case scenarios to start with, those serve to exaggerate the threat to normal livelihoods and thus lend credibility to the even more daunting prospect of the clinical conditioning of people. In this case, it is specifically the conditioning of one violent individual, but it's very easy to extend the principle to those with whom the government, or state, might disagree - and Kubrick lays that threat bare for all to see and evaluate. I struggled a bit with the nonsense language at times, it seemed puerile and prone to ridicule, certainly to detract from, the more thought-provoking elements of the plot. Perhaps it is there to serve as steam-valve for the intensity of the subject matter, but I am not convinced it is effective or necessary. The book allows us scope to use our own imagination as to the terror this whole concept could invoke, but as film adaptations go, this one offers us a great and innovative template for any interpretation, and coupled with the powerful use of a classical music score - including Ludwig Van, of course, and a solid supporting cast contributing well, this is a truly momentous piece of cinema."", 'The film is based on Anthony Burgess‘ novel about young Alex Delarge and his droogs who go around tolchocking people and partaking of the ultraviolence and the old in-out-in-out.\r\n\r\nYes, the language is a futuristic mix of Russian, slang and made-up words that Burgess employed so that the futuristic language employed would never sound dated. He called it Nadsat. By the end of the film, for better or worse, you will understand the language.\r\n\r\n**Note: This may be too detailed for those who have not seen the film, so I advise reading it after a viewing.**\r\n\r\nAlex likes violence, sex, and Beethoven. He is the leader of a gang (droogs) and in the first part of the film we witness a typical evening: beating up an old veck (derelict, tramp); breaking into the house of a writer and beating him up and forcing him to witness the rape of his wife (in the book it is this writer who coins the term “A Clockwork Orange”), then heading back to the Korova Milkbar.\r\n\r\nWe are shown Alex’s home: his parents are a rather dull and passive pair. Alex’s bedroom has all the mod-cons, including a pet snake! He also has a state-of-the-art hi-fi on which he listens to his favourite piece of music – Beethoven’s Ninth.\r\n\r\nThere is dissent in his group’s ranks, to which Alex reacts with violence. However, having asserted his leadership Alex and his droogs go on another evening’s rampage. Alex kills a woman in her house, but is locked in by his vindictive droogs. He is caught and sentenced to 14 years. Two years later, the current Government has promised to do something about the gross prison overcrowding so they employ a new technique that makes the offender feel ill when confronted with violent feelings (the Ludivico Technique). Alex volunteers for the treatment because he will get released after two weeks.\r\n\r\nAfter the two weeks of receiving the treatment we witness a debasing example of its efficacy conducted in front of his old prison warders and chaplain – who is opposed to the treatment on the grounds that it removes people’s free will. Alex is released.\r\n\r\nGoing home he finds his belongings have been reclaimed by the state, his snake is dead, and his room has been let to a lodger on two-year’s contract. Homeless and with no belongings he meets two of his old droogs who effect their revenge on him. Bloodied, he stumbles across a house and is taken in by the very writer whose wife he raped – and who has since died, attributed by the writer to the rape. Not recognising Alex at first (because they wore masks) he eventually realises who he has taken in and conspires to exact his revenge and at the same time, with the help of his friends, provide ammunition for those who oppose the Government’s scientific methods of rehabilitating prisoners.\r\n\r\nStripped of his ability to defend himself, Alex now has become a victim.\r\n\r\nThat Alex survives this is no surprise to viewers, considering he is narrating the story; having been nearly killed by his previous victim, the Government has to take action to enforce damage limitation – Alex’s treatment must be reversed. His ability to enjoy violence must be restored.\r\n\r\nIt’s difficult to view this film in the present day and understand what caused such furore on its original release. There is brutality and rape, but I have seen far worse in mainstream films and by modern standards these scenes are quite tame – and when looked at in the cold light of day there is more suggestion than depiction. I suppose the fact this film is now available on DVD indicates a shift in what is regarded as “acceptable”.\r\n\r\nAs with all of Stanley Kubrick‘s films, it is a carefully engineered story, the music a mixture of “futuristic” synthesiser courtesy of Walter Carlos (now Wendy Carlos, yes, he had a sex-change) and classical music and “Singin’ in the Rain” – the song Alex sings while the writer’s wife is raped.\r\n\r\nIt is a well-made film, full of satire and messages about the free-will of people versus the rights of others to be protected; about how far the state should go to rehabilitate, questions about is it even rehabilitation, and the religious arguments stirred up concerning the removal of one’s free will.\r\n\r\nThere is satire on political machinations and expediency and the love-hate relationship between the press and those in power, how the press can be a weapon against the Government, and its ally. There is a swipe at the fervent belief that God will always provide the answers provided we are patient and wait.\r\n\r\nFinally, there is a sideswipe at man’s insistence that Science offers the answer to all things, perhaps the main thrust of the book, and that which gives it its title: “ – The attempt to impose upon man, a creature of growth and capable of sweetness, to ooze juicily at the last round the bearded lips of God, to attempt to impose, I say, laws and conditions appropriate to a mechanical creation, against this I raise my sword-pen —.“\r\n\r\nI recommend the film.']"

It\'s an interesting study on humanity this, centred around something so apparently pedestrian as losing a bike, but the cascading impact of that event on their lives and their relationship as well as with the profound effects on their livelihood and self respect are expertly laid out by De Rica, who draws us gradually into their series of adventures. The simplicity of the story also engenders an opportunity to look at the poverty endured by many sections of the citizenry (those who sit through the mass so they can be rewarded with a bowl of soup rather than worrying about any redemption of their soul, for example). The performance from the young Staiola is excellent. He plays the role of the young boy with considerable natural skill - his character has no real idea of why this bike is so important, nor of why it\'s loss is causing his father\'s behaviour to vacillate - but like a loyal puppy, he continues to help out, even saving the day at one stage. The settings in this ancient city add considerably to the sense of despair - ruins (old and new) - and at times they make you wonder of life here has really moved on so much from Roman times.

A must seen.', ""**The universality and invincibility of Death, the fear of dying, the importance of faith and its use by the Church in a timeless film, but not suitable for everyone.**\r\n\r\nThe film, set in the late Middle Ages, begins with a knight returning to his homeland in Sweden after participating in the crusades. When he spots the figure of Death, who has come to get him, he decides to try to gain time by inviting her to play chess: if he wins the game, Death will not take him.\r\n\r\nWhat follows is a huge film essay around the themes of death, beliefs, faith, religion and the role of spirituality in human experience. While the plague is raging and claiming victims, we see people increasingly scared, and blindly resorting to faith to protect themselves from what looks like the end of times. We see people's daily lives, with their mistakes, virtues, sins and difficulties. We see the knight himself, with a growing fear of dying and struggling with deeper and deeper doubts about faith, the existence of God. Furthermore, we also see how the Church exploited the fear of death to reinforce its power, influence and relevance within uneducated communities shaken by the epidemic. The ending is simple, but there is a deep meaning in it.\r\n\r\nSwedish filmmaker Ingmar Bergman's masterpiece seems to have its origins in his own fear of death. Max von Sydow, who gave life to the knight, is the greatest actor present in the film and gives us a strong and impactful performance. The film has gained notoriety over the decades and has become one of the most timeless and culturally significant classics of European cinema. However, it is not a film for everyone. Its simplicity, the way it approaches very complicated and philosophical themes and the ending that is difficult to understand at first glance are more than enough reasons why many people do not like this film, and I have to admit that there is a reason. For me personally, it wasn't a success, it's not a movie you want to see regularly, but I recognize its value.""]"

Winter. Two horsebacked slave-traders are leading half-a-dozen manacled negro slaves through a large, unspecified section of Texas. As they move one night through a wood, they cross paths with an affable, charming German fellow identified by the hokey model tooth affixed atop his carriage by a spring as a travelling dentist. He greets the traders cordially but he\'s struggling to be understood; not because English is his second language (although he deferentially concedes as much when instructed - more than once - to ""Speak English!"") but because his vocabulary is far wider than that of the simpler men here before him. It\'s not a chance passing, either; this German fellow, who identifies himself as Dr. King Schultz (played by Christoph Waltz with the same smiling, deadly menace that earned him an Oscar statue for his part as Col. Hans Landa in Inglourious Basterds) is looking for these traders. More specifically, their inventory of negro slaves. Even more specifically, one of those slaves in particular. Django (Jamie Foxx, Collateral, Ray). Attempting to buy Django, Schultz is met with short, suspicious shrift and ordered at gunpoint to be on his way. Within a second, one trader lies dead and the other lies incapacitated underneath the bulk of his dead horse. Schultz unchains Django, instructs Django to take the dead fellow\'s horse and coat, and pays the remaining trader for all that he\'s taken. He then tosses the manacle key to the other slaves and posits two choices to them, as he sees it: Carry their injured master thirty-plus miles to the nearest town for medical assistance, or unchain themselves, blow the injured slave-trader\'s head off with the gun Shultz has left them, bury the corpses and use the Pole Star to run for the Northern states, where slavery had been abolished, and for more than fifty years in some areas. Funnily enough, they take up the latter option.\r\n\r\nSo begins Django Unchained, an oater set in the slave states of the Deep South and the latest rollercoaster by Gen-X movieland wunderkind Quentin Tarantino. Always clearly a man heavily informed by the grindhouse subgenre of the Spaghetti Western, he\'s finally made one himself, and if Quentin\'s your thing it\'s a blast, though I doubt it\'ll convert many Tarantino sceptics; in fact it\'ll almost certainly reinforce those things that people dislike about him, about which more later.\r\n\r\nIt transpires that Dr. Schultz ISN\'T a dentist (""I haven\'t practised dentistry in five years,"" he confides to Django over a beer) but a bounty hunter, and a lethal one at that. He\'s chasing down the Brittles, a murderous gang of brothers currently plying their trades as plantation overseers. He doesn\'t know what they look like but he knows they were recently employed at the Carrucan plantation, which is why he was searching for Django - a slave recently sold by that very plantation - in the first place; Django can point them out for him. Schultz is no fan of the South\'s backwards-thinking propensity for slavery though, and he offers Django a deal: help Schultz find and kill the Brittle Brothers, Schultz will treat Django like a free man, pay him $75 (a decent little wedge in 1858) and rubber-stamp his freedom. Along the way, he\'ll also teach Django a thing or two about the art of gunfighting and about the macabre trade of bounty-hunting (both in which Django proves to be a natural). On the trail of the Brittles, Schultz wonders aloud as to Django\'s plans once this endeavour is over and he\'s free. Well, as it happens, Django is a married man and his intention, once free, is to find his wife and buy her freedom. They\'d tried to run from the Carrucan plantation together but they\'d been caught, branded (both Django and his wife - played with all of her nerves exposed by Kerry Washington - sport R-For-Runaway scars on their cheeks) and sold on, separately. So he doesn\'t know where she is but that\'s what he\'s going to try to do. Schultz, feeling responsible for Django as the man granting him his freedom, proposes a further deal: If this Brittle bounty goes well, he\'ll honour Django\'s freedom but if Django stays with him through the winter as partners, taking on bounties and earning money, he\'ll help Django locate his wife.\r\n\r\nWhat we have here is a large sequence of set-pieces - some funny, some tense, some action-packed - stretched across very-nearly three hours (though, like most QT films, it moves like a bullet train and those three hours just fly) strung together by a fairly simple revenge/rescue tale set against a geographically sprawling backdrop; a reasonably similar template to many of Quentin\'s movies and an almost identical template to that of previous outing Inglourious Basterds, to which Django Unchained could almost be considered a companion piece despite the wildly different global and historical settings. Like Inglourious Basterds, Django Unchained is quite a bit longer than the story need be, and like Inglourious Basterds that is because each scene is treated by Tarantino as a mini movie, a contained set-piece all of its own. Every scene is fleshed out and deepened for either heightened comic or dramatic effect by lengthened sequences of characters going about the mundane or by characters delivering enormous monologues - rambling shaggy-dog stories, usually - to one another, for context. Not every scene is entirely necessary, either. I wouldn\'t call that a flaw though, I\'d call it a trait typical of Quentin Tarantino; whether it\'s a flaw or an outright treat depends entirely on whether that\'s an element of Tarantino\'s writing that the viewer appreciates. Personally, I love Tarantino\'s writer\'s voice and I could watch these scenes for hours (indeed, I watched Django Unchained three times over the course of yesterday), but I can fully undersand what those lamenting the decent 90-minute film that\'s lost somewhere within the sojourns and speeches of Django Unchained are saying.\r\n\r\nPerformances throughout are utterly mesmerising, from stars Foxx and Waltz but also - in fact, maybe more so - from principle antagonists Leonardo DiCaprio as ""Monsieur"" Calvin Candie, the horrifying owner of the ""Candyland"" plantation currently holding the ownership deeds on Django\'s wife, and Samuel L. Jackson in an if-anything even more monstrous role as Stephen, Candie\'s elderly head house slave, a man who has utterly abndoned the culture and torment of his people in return for a few material trappings as the slave-in-chief. Playing to superb comedic effect is Don Johnson as Big Daddy, a strutting, peacock-like Tennessee dandy and owner of the plantation currently employing the Brittle Brothers, and delightful in cameo roles are (among many others) James Remar (The Warriors, Dexter), Jonah Hill (Superbad, The Watch), John Jarratt (Wolf Creek, Rogue) and Michael Parks (Red State, Kill Bill). Quentin himself makes a cameo as usual and, as usual, he\'s not as charming as he probably thinks he is, but he\'s also not as bad as many think he is, either. There\'s even a quick cameo (raising an involuntary cheer from me!) by Franco Nero, the original Django from the magnificent 1966 film of the same name by Sergio Corbucci (that\'s not the only nod back to the first Django movie; the opening credits to Django Unchained are presented in exactly the same way as the original, and the theme song to Quentin\'s film comes directly from the Corbucci film too).\r\n\r\nDjango Unchained is likely to come under fire on a couple of counts; possibly for it\'s incredible levels of bloodshed (one particular gunfight is the most blood-splattered scene I\'ve seen in a movie since those elevator doors opened in The Shining), and much more probably for the liberal use of what guilty white folks like to refer to as ""The \'N\'-word"", uttered literally hundreds of times from first scene to last. However, neither criticism is warranted in my humble opinion. The bloodshed is of the overexaggerated cartoon quality. Heads, arteries and extremities explode upon bullet impact like detonated watermelons to a gloopy, ""BLAAAPP!"" sound effect, the blood itself translucent, syrupy and intentionally unrealistic. And if a tale is set against the backdrop of slavery in the 19th century deep South, you\'re going to hear the word ""Nigger"" in that tale. Often. Be assured though that just as Inglourious Basterds was a revenge fantasy of the downtrodden Jewish war refugees over the stupidly evil Nazi Germans, this is a tale of empowerment of the enslaved black man over his sadistic, pig-ignorant white overseers.\r\n\r\nIf you like Tarantino, you\'ll probably like Django Unchained. If you like Westerns (and the blood-drenched Spaghetti Westerns of the late sixties in particular), you\'ll probably like Django Unchained. If, like me, you\'re an admirer of both Tarantino AND westerns, this is a no-brainer. Get and see it, it\'s a blast.\r\n\r\nI\'d like to have seen him pull a Gatling gun out of a coffin, though.', 'A highly entertaining yet disturbing film with superb cast and performances for an audience who would likely never consider watching a film fundamentally about slavery, where Tarantino is masterfully and emphatically navigating and exposing the complex layers of the violent and dehumanizing system of slavery.', '**ENTERTAINING from start to finish !!**\r\n\r\nGiven I am a big fan of **Quentin\'s** works i knew this movie would be a treat to watch.But what i didn\'t know was violence can be so **COOL**... The movie is a treat to watch(including the blood and gore) from starting to end.The acting is superb.And the cinematography is just too good! The whole cast played their parts to perfection...Especially **Samuel L. Jackson** and **Jamie Foxx**..**Leo and Christopher Waltz** were superb too..And as Christopher said in the movie - ""It was hard to RESIST"".A must watch for everyone who likes QUALITY cinema..Even the ones who cant stand BOOMs and BANGs, you wouldn\'t regret spending about 3 hours watching this well written, well directed and well acted GREAT movie !!', 'This is one of the best movies I have watched in a long time. It is a pure Tarantino blast. The somewhat unexpected and quite hilarious start of the movie catches your attention from the start and from then on it is 3 hours (almost) of pure enjoyment. \n\nThe main actors are playing their roles very well. The Dr. King Schultz character (Christop Walz) is incredibly funny without being ridiculous, Jamie Foxx is excellent as Django and Leonardo DiCaprio is doing his role well as a plantation owner and slave trader. None of the rest of the crew stood out as particularly bad. Well with the possible exception of Tarantino himself then when he made his usual in-movie appearance a’ la Hitchcock. Not that he was particularly bad but he is no actor either.\n\nThe movie starts of by Dr. Schulz liberating Django and proceeding to a small town showing Django what he is in the business of doing. Those first minutes of the movie are somewhat unexpected and very funny to watch. After that the movie gets more serious as Django gets to learn to be a bounty hunter and finally gets on with his quest to rescue his “Damsel in distress”. It still has quite a bit of “Tarantino humour” sprinkled around in it though.\n\nDuring the movie we are treated to a long series of stereotypical people with, let us say, an “attitude” towards African people. It is tempting to say “nigger haters” but that would not be true since a lot of these people did not exactly hate them. They just did not consider African people to be people but more than live stock for them to use as they wished. Unlike a lot of movies portraying these events this one never comes across as boringly finger pointing or overly morally lecturing. Nor does it in any way support or glorify the way things were at this time. It is a movie made to entertain set in a period where bad shit happened and using it for the story. Nothing more and nothing less.\n\nAs usual with a Tarantino movie there are some violent parts, some more violent parts and some bloody violent parts in it. The ending fights are a glorious show of destruction and blood splatter. I am sure some people are complaining about the “unnecessary violence”. I am not one of those people. Without these parts it would not be a real Tarantino movie. As always it is made with the usual exaggeration that Tarantino is so good and which reminds you that it is “only a movie”.\nThis is one of the few movies that I have given 10 out of 10 stars in a very long time. I enjoyed it immensely.', 'When Django is unchained (pronounced JANG-oh, not Duh-JANG-oh)\r\n\r\nReleased in 2012 and directed & written by Quentin Tarantino, ""Django Unchained"" stars Christoph Waltz as an ex-dentist who befriends an ex-slave, Django (Jamie Foxx) in West Texas a couple of years before the Civil War; they team-up as bounty hunters once they realize how good they jell. The second half focuses on their attempt to infiltrate a Mississippi plantation owned by pompous Southerner ""Monsieur"" Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio) in order to rescue Django\'s wife (Kerry Washington). Samuel L. Jackson plays Candie\'s overly loyal house slave.\r\n\r\nThis is an excellent American Western with Spaghetti Western elements featuring Tarantino\'s typical artistic flourishes. It takes place in the West AND in the South, which is reminiscent of the underrated ""Nevada Smith"" (1966), one of my favorite Westerns. Waltz is magnetic as the nonchalant protagonist and he & Foxx have good chemistry. There\'s a nice mix of interesting dialogues, amusing moments and over-the-top action. Unfortunately, but to be expected, Tarantino goes overboard with the \'n\' word and the blood-letting, the latter to the point of cartoonish-ness. \r\n\r\nNevertheless, this is an original Western that is vibrant with creativity, including stunning locations, cinematography and a great amalgamated soundtrack/score, which includes cuts by Ennio Morricone, like the excellent ""Hornets\' Nest,"" the imaginative ""The Braying Mule"" and the moving ""Ancora Qui."" It\'s all-around superior to ""The Hateful Eight"" (2015) because it\'s not limited by a one-room whodunit plot (although ""Hateful"" has its unique points of interest).\r\n\r\nThe movie runs 165 minutes and was shot in Jackson Hole, Wyoming; Evergreen Plantation & New Orleans, Louisiana; and several locations in California (Lone Pine, Alabama Hills, Semi Valley, Melody Ranch, Santa Clarita, Independence & Los Angeles). The cast includes numerous peripheral notables, e.g. Ato Essandohs, Don Stroud, James Remar, Bruce Dern, Ato Essandoh, Franco Nero, Don Johnson, Amber Tamblyn and several others.\r\n\r\nGRADE: A', 'Django Unchained entertained me, for sure, with its taut storyline and its lack of predictability, but it doesn’t rise to the level of my few favorite Tarantino efforts.\r\n\r\nThe trademark violence is present, sometimes to the point of it being cartoonish to me. It would have been easy to present many of the characters as stereotypical, but the script avoided that. The DiCaprio slave owner is vicious and cruel, but there are flashes of flexibility concerning the status quo with his slaves. And his elderly house slave  seems to act more like a slave owner than he does.\r\n\r\nA chemistry develops between the two lead characters as they work as bounty hunters, and that is satisfying to see. There are the usual sometimes subtle nods to other films, and I felt the influence of Spaghetti Westerns here and there.\r\n\r\nAs I said, I enjoyed the film, even though I won’t be watching it multiple times as I do with other Tarantino movies. If you have the stomach for violence and portrayed extreme And presumably historically accurate racism, give it a look.', 'Mandingo. D\'Artagnan. Slave abuse. Tarantino\'s technique of capturing the painful discrimination against blacks head-on and, on the contrary, making it cathartic in the final scene is brilliant. Starting with the impressive theme song, nonstop violence replaces it, giving us a glimpse into the kaleidoscope of horrific American society. Leonardo DiCaprio\'s monstrous performance and Christoph Waltz\'s near-perfect supporting turn are the main reasons for the film\'s appeal, but Quentin Tarantino\'s screenplay, which deliberately intersects revenge and black racism and ends up making us sneer at those who looked down on the slaves, is nothing short of brilliant.\r\nNext to ""Pulp Fiction"" this is Quentin\'s best film.']"

Their protagonist is Leonard Shelby, played with stupendous believability by Guy Pearce, who is suffering from a memory amnesia caused by a trauma to the head as he tried to aide his wife who was raped and murdered. He can remember things before the incident, but anything post that and he can't form a memory. So who can he trust? Does he know any of the few people who appear to be in his life at the present time? He tattoos his body to help him remember, constantly writes notes to keep him alert in his now alien world, while all the time he is on the search for the man who ruined his life.\r\n\r\nChristopher Nolan plants the audience right into Leonard's world. By using a reverse story telling structure it's deliberately complex and ingenious given that it opens with the ending! It has been argued that it's trickery for trickery sake, style over substance, but the way each scene is built upon in the narrative is a thing of high quality, it's all relevant and demands the closest of attention from the viewer, where cheekily we are ourselves asked to form memories of prior narrative passages. Mystery is strong throughout, the characters currently in Leonard's life may have different means and motives, it keeps us alert, with the confusion, lies, manipulations, enigmas and amnesia angles booming with neo-noir vibrancy. And the Nolan's know their noir of course, adding a narrator who is hard to define or trust himself!\r\n\r\nThe reverse structure wasn't new in 2000, but Christopher Nolan picks up the idea and adds new strands to it, simultaneously bringing his visual ticks as David Julyan's musical score shifts from elegiac forebodings to pulse pounding dread, and as evidenced by the darling easter egg option that allows one to watch it in chronological order, it's a damn fine thriller without the reverse trickery anyway. Super. 9/10"", ""Excellent. I can't believe I've finally gotten around to watching all of Christopher Nolan's films (I have 'The Prestige' on DVD, but have yet to see it), but it's been well worth the wait. There are a couple of handful of English-language directors operating right now that I will make sure I watch every single film of, and Nolan has become one of those for me, and rightfully so. A very fine twist on the noir framework."", '‘Memento’ is director Christopher Nolan’s tribute to classic film noir tales of revenge and mystery. By adding a new twist to traditional conventions, Nolan is able to consume and grip the viewer throughout the entire film and for years after. The aspect that differentiates this neo-noir from its competitors today is its jumbled and complex narrative which continually moves backwards in time. The viewers first see the main character complete his revenge murder (a triumphant scene we usually associate with the ending of film noirs). We then begin to see events unfold backwards and the reason for this becomes clear.\r\n\r\nLeonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) and his wife are attacked in their home. His wife is murdered but Guy Pearce is left with a brain condition that disables him from creating anymore short-term memory. Constantly being reminded of the horror of the situation, he is relentlessly spurred on to get his revenge on his wife’s killer. As the viewer progresses through the film, they begin to feel more and more like Lenny. The audience have no idea of what has happened prior to the scene currently showing and so we are left feeling the same confusion as our protagonist. To cope with his condition, he maintains a system of notes, photographs, and tattoos to record information about himself and others, including his wife\'s killer. He is aided in his investigation by ""Teddy"" (Joe Pantoliano) and Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss), neither of whom he can really trust (both of the latter actors starred together in ‘The Matrix (1999)’ in which Pantoliano was not to be trusted, disorientating the informed viewer more).\r\n\r\nThe film\'s events unfold in two separate, alternating narratives—one in colour, and the other in black and white. Leonard\'s investigation is depicted in five-minute colour sequences that are in reverse chronological order, however, the short black and white scenes are shown in chronological order and show Leonard on the phone to a mysterious stranger having a conversation that the viewers cannot understand (these sequences are more direct references to the film noir genre that Christopher Nolan is embracing). This style of directing makes the audience completely empathise with Leonard’s situation as you never know more than he does, but also it creates huge comedic and emotional moments which rely heavily on the notion of dramatic irony.\r\n\r\nWith Nolan’s use of handheld camera work, an overtone of pink colouring, and sharp editing (the only transition effects in use are occasional fade outs) the viewer is made to feel disorientated and is therefore able to empathise more with Leonard’s character. The original idea was a short story by Nolan’s brother, Jonathan who also helped with the screenplay. The dialogue in the film is its best feature with its insightful, powerful and heart-wrenching speeches about the nature of memory. As we learn how we rely upon memory for our sense of reality, we begin to question reality itself.  The idea of faith and constant references to the bible can make the entire film a metaphor for people’s faith in Christianity or any other religion at that.\r\n\r\n★★★★★', ""Structuring the film in such a way that the viewer knows as little as the protagonist, the Nolan's have created a nifty puzzle that slowly unravels to its climax.\r\n\r\n8/10"", ""Phenomenal.\r\n\r\nWhat a movie! I had heard plenty about <em>'Memento'</em> prior to watching in regards to how high-quality it supposedly was, though didn't actually (thankfully) get spoiled on anything that occurs onscreen - I did know of the note-taking, though for some reason thought it was via post-it notes rather than polaroids - no idea why!\r\n\r\nIt's a very satisfying movie come the conclusion, concentration is very much the order of the day but the film does connect enough dots rather sharpish.

Now we don\'t know how he has developed his menacing ninja skills, but we do know that he is trying to get to the bottom of his wife\'s murder, and that he has virtually no short-term memory to help him. As he pieces things together, he has to leave himself notes, or polaroids augmented with scribbles so he can recall just how far he has got and whom he can (or cannot) trust. The facts that he considers crucial are tattooed across his body as his search narrows - or does it? Along the way he meets some characters that he has some documentation on - some, not. Some he advises himself to trust, some not. Some of the photos depict dead bodies. On those fronts, we do have just a little more information on the cause tan he does - but it doesn\'t really help anyone deduce who did kill his wife? Maybe he did it himself? Its a maze of a film this. It\'s littered with twists and complications - but they are not annoying nor gratuitous. It\'s the ultimate in cinematic one step forward two steps back, and those muddled scenarios are only emphasised by ""Natalie"" (Carrie-Anne Moss) and an on-form Joe Pantoliano as ""Teddy"" - a man who features increasingly as his quest proceeds. I also did enjoy the ending. It avoids the concrete and the simplistic, and offers a fitting end to a potently effective effort from a Pearce at the top of his game.', 'A similar style to Inception, pay attention or you’ll lose it']"

I had to watch the thing again and wiki Hamilton to try to figure out who was who except for some of the bigger names.  \r\n\r\nGoing by the poster, this is was meant to be some attempted rise to fame of Harry Potter in Hollywood.  \r\nThe casting was varied, which is great generally, but not representative of history (noone looked like what they should have).  \r\nHistorical themes seemed to be swapped around and added in for convenience-sake.   \r\nSome performances were good, Soo, Groff and Diggs, whilst others (MIranda - who was better in Mary Poppins Returns) just felt flat and tired.  \r\nIt felt like 6 or so cameras were placed and then just recorded.  \r\nAnd the choreography was distracting at times, not complimentary.  \r\nAnd character development - the only one who shows any is Soo's character.  \r\n\r\nThis might be a great musical, but it is not a great movie (despite what people are reviewing it as).  It is hard to follow as a citizen of the world who does not know US political history details nor its players.  Its cinematography, casting and set pieces felt lazy (this could have been turned into grand cinema). \r\nAnd it was overly long...people might expect this type of thing to go for hours on West End to get their money's worth, but 2hrs 40 is overkill in this medium.  \r\n\r\nThe hype behind this made me think this was brilliant.

On the one hand, there was such a tremendous hype for it as a play, it built the expectation of being blown away, and on the other hand, it being presented in its live theater version made it lose some of the visual impact of seeing it in person. We expect a greater production value on the screen.\r\n\r\nThe story is great, and should be required viewing for children at a certain age. I confess, I wasn’t enthralled by it as a musical. I guess I am too used to musicals that have regular dialogue broken up by songs rather than continuous sung dialogue. If there had been dialogue surroundIng eight or ten lovely songs like Helpless, I would have given it top marks. It is still an impressive production.\r\n\r\nI feel I have to comment on the diverse cast. I am white and had no problem with the cast choices. I would have cried foul if they had presented an all white cast as some seem to think was required. I had an acquaintance complain, “What if they cast a white actor as Martin Luther King? And all I can do is flip it upside down. There are only a half-dozen people of color in our history books for every hundred Caucasians, and if it reaches the point where whites stop whining when people of color play those roles, I am convinced that people of color will be totally fine with whites playing the roles of people of color. But we aren’t there yet, are we?', 'This is not a Movie. It is a television program. It is a filmed stage play that is being broadcast on television. These things do not add up to this being a film, not even a TV-movie.', '""My name is Alexander Hamilton/And there\'s a million things I haven\'t done/But just you wait, just you wait,"" Lin-Manuel Miranda sort of sings at the beginning of Hamilton. About three hours later we\'re still waiting.\r\n\r\nHamilton is divided into two acts. The first covers Hamilton\'s arrival in New York City in 1776, his work as General George Washington\'s aide-de-camp during the American Revolution, and how he met and married Eliza Schuyler.\r\n\r\nThe second covers Hamilton\'s postwar work as the first United States Secretary of the Treasury and his death in a duel with Aaron Burr. The first act is strictly hagiographic; Hamilton is so messianic that Burr (Leslie Odom Jr.) might as well be called Judas.\r\n\r\nWatching the meteoric rise of the protagonist\'s military and political career unfold in song and dance form, I began to experience a revelation; if they changed the historical pe-riod and characters, this could easily become Forrest Gump: The Musical.\r\n\r\nWe never really get a sense of why Hamilton was so special, important, and essential in the lives of so many people; his success seems to be the result of a geographical-temporal accident — that is to say, Hamilton is always in the right place at the right time.\r\n\r\nMiranda has allegedly written songs with many adjectives and very few verbs; lyrics that care more about the \'what\' than the \'how\' and \'why\'. ""How does a bastard, orphan, son of a whore/And a Scots-man, dropped in the middle of a forgotten spot/In the Caribbean by providence impoverished/In squalor, grow up to be a hero and a scholar?""\r\n\r\nThat’s a good question, deserving of a better answer than ""by working a lot harder/By being a lot smarter/By being a self-starter."" And, apparently, by being vague as all hell. Hamilton thus moves from one plot point to the next as in a dream, without ever conjuring up a precise image of the cha-racter\'s trajectory.\r\n\r\nThe second act is more specific about Hamilton\'s legacy; the character stops just \'being\' and starts \'doing.\' There is, however, another problem here.\r\n\r\nThe real Hamilton was more a man of words than actions, and his writings must surely be fascinating to the appropriate reader; on the other hand, one doesn’t read him for the sheer entertainment value.\r\n\r\nTo mention just one example, Hamilton helped ratify the United States Constitution by writing 51 of the 85 essays known as The Federalist Papers, which are still used as one of the most important\r\nreferences for the interpretation of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nThis is almost as impressive as it is boring, and all the hip hop choreography in the world can\'t change the fact that Miranda\'s alleged songs, although true to the spirit of the statesman who inspired them, are devoid of all trace of showmanship.\r\n\r\nThese are long, heavily expository litanies, laden with facts and dates, as if written by a high school student who can’t remember his History otherwise. Meanwhile, King George III of England (Jona-than Groff, who steals the show in his too brief and few appearances) is depicted as a buffoon, but has the catchiest song in the entire production.\r\n\r\nAll of the above notwithstanding, Hamilton\'s biggest flaw is Miranda himself. As a composer he clearly favors quantity over quality, but a performer with authority and presence might have been able, with a superhuman effort, to elevate the author\'s pedestrian material.\r\n\r\nMiranda is very far from being that performer; his dancing can be generously described as spastic, and his singing is more of an irritating nasal whine, as if he inhaled helium before each number — as opposed to the oxygen for which he visibly gasps as he tries to sing and dance at the same time.\r\n\r\nOh, and to be perfectly non-PC, his physical resemblance to the Bumblebee Man from The Simp-sons isn’t very pleasing either. All things considered, Miranda surrounds himself with a wonderful cast; so wonderful indeed that each individual member, as well as the ensemble as a whole, outshines the star, who is exposed as a black hole of charisma and talent that sucks all the joy out of singing and dancing.', 'If you didn\'t know going in, this isn\'t either a film or a TV show. It\'s a recording of the Broadway play of the same name.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, this play is for Americans who already have some idea of history. That probably excludes the younger generations, since the public school systems have gone south with years of Republican under-funding. (Seriously, some teachers make less than burger flippers.)\r\n\r\nAs a stage actor and a history buff, I loved this play and am so sorry I didn\'t get a chance to see it on Broadway. There are multiple reasons I gave this a nine, the major of which is that I\'m rating it as a play, not a film.\r\n\r\nFirst, I was blown away by the creativity. There is no spoken dialogue which is unusual for a musical. Second, it\'s done nearly all in hip-hop/rap, with one set-piece even in slam battle. The staging is great.  Kudos for creative use of a turntable. I was blown away by the amazing, seemingly complicated, ""rewind"" scene.\r\n\r\nYes, it may or may not be historically accurate.

It stars Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Spacey, Kevin Pollack, Stephen Baldwin, Benicio Del Toro, Chazz Palminteri, Pete Postlethwaite, Giancarlo Esposito and Dan Hedaya. Music is by John Ottman and cinematography by Newton Thomas Sigel.\r\n\r\nHeld in an L.A. interrogation room, Verbal Kint (Spacey) attempts to convince the feds that a mythic crime lord, Keyser Soze, not only exists, but was also responsible for drawing him and his four partners into a multi-million dollar heist that ended with an explosion in San Pedro harbor – leaving few survivors. \r\n\r\nIt sort of sidled into movie theatres in 1995 with no fanfare or heralded notices. Yet it wasn\'t long before word of mouth got around that The Usual Suspects might actually be the must see film of the year. Fledgeling director and writer - Singer and McQuarrie - produce a masterclass of crime/mystery/noir plotting in a whirl of intricate plot shifts and deft sleights of hand.\r\n\r\nThe core essence of the story is simple, just who is Keyser Soze? His reputation is one of utter fear, he may even be the devil himself. What transpires throughout the film is a number of scenes told in flashback form and narrated by Kint as the cops put the heat on him. \r\n\r\nWe are introduced to the five criminals who make up the suspects of the title, where dialogue pings with machismo laced humour. The addition of Postlethwaite\'s Kobayashi character, one of Soze\'s harbinger\'s of doom, further ups the ante of the story\'s deliciously corkscrew intrigue.\r\n\r\nIt all builds to a climax that - has you pondering just what you have watched previously. Yet here\'s the key as to why the pic still holds up on repeat viewings, we have been outsmarted, for as we dive in and enjoy the across the board great perfs, we have been privy to something that will stand the test of time for the genre it sits in. The repeat viewings factor still, some decades later, is as strong as ever.\r\n\r\nThe advent of time and home format releases etc have only improved the pic\'s own mythical status. Behind the scenes egos and dislikes on set only add further strength to the characterisations, as does one main man thinking he himself must be Soze when in fact he was way off. There\'s a trail of clues in the film that will reveal who Soze is - who knew!? - and on it goes. The Usual Suspects is the filmic gift that keeps on giving. 10/10', ""**A clever twist and heavy fan support are the only stand-out aspects of this average heist film.**\r\n\r\nBloggers, reviews, and friends hyped The Usual Suspects for years before I finally watched it, and it was ok. The movie had a pretty clever plot twist that the entire film was building towards from the beginning. Unfortunately, without the twist, the film is pretty mediocre. Brute force characterized the heists over clever planning. Keyser Söze's brilliant manipulation of the characters around him seems less mastermind and more taking advantage of criminals that aren't the sharpest tools in the shed. Many people would disagree with me, but The Usual Suspects rates average at best for me."", '**A film that deserves to be revisited and remembered.**\r\n\r\nI think it\'s unfair that this movie seems to be so forgotten nowadays, but maybe that\'s because of the intricate plot, loaded with flashbacks. I can understand that, but I think there are even more confusing films out there that have never gone out of style. Anyway, it\'s a quality film, with good actors and a story, to say the least, intriguing. A small note: the film took home both Oscars for which it was nominated (Best Original Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor).\r\n\r\nIt all starts when a group of men, apparently random, is taken by the police to participate in a line-up. What seems at first very casual, is not: all of them were criminals well known to the authorities, and most particularly one of them, who was also a policeman and seemed to have retired from crime and to be living an honest life. After this opening scene, the film shows the efforts of the police to capture those responsible for a shooting on a boat, with several dead and a single survivor, who will tell everything that happened. And I say no more because this script is one of those that gets better the less you know in advance.\r\n\r\nThe cast is dominated by two great actors: Gabriel Byrne and Kevin Spacey. Each in their respective character, but both very committed to their work, they steal the public\'s attention whenever they appear, ending up being, in a way, complementary: Spacey gives life to an apparently fragile and sick man who would be the most unlikely suspect, whereas Byrne is the typical ""tough guy"". I don\'t know if I can say that this film is Spacey\'s best so far, maybe that\'s premature, but it\'s safe that his work here opened doors for him to fly higher. Four years later, he would go on to win the Oscar for Best Actor with “American Beauty”. Byrne, on the other hand, is one of those talented actors who never seem to have had their big moment in cinema. I also want to highlight the good work of Pete Postlethwaite, in yet another secondary character of strong relevance, two years after receiving his (only so far) Oscar nomination.\r\n\r\nTechnically, I think it\'s worth praising the direction of Bryan Singer, who stayed true to the suspense and managed to resist the temptation to let the film slip into loud and noisy action scenes that weren\'t really necessary. The best thing about the film is the tense environment it builds, the enigmatic and mysterious way in which it tells its story, and this would have been partly lost if the director filled his film with random shootings and chases. Another point that deserves a note of praise is the soundtrack, and in particular the main theme, used in the opening and end credits, and which is perfectly atmospheric. The rest remains average, but is done without glaring errors. The only points I feel I should criticize negatively are the opening credits graphics, which look very dated now.', 'Upon watching The Usual Suspects, I was initially excited to see what all the hype was about however, I found the film to be somewhat of a letdown. That being said, I do think that there were some strong aspects to the movie.\r\n\r\nFrom a technical standpoint, The Usual Suspects was quite impressive. The camera direction by Bryan Singer was particularly noteworthy, especially given that this was only his second full-length feature film.\r\n\r\nWhere the movie fell short for me was in the writing. While the dialogue and overall story were intriguing, the way they were executed left much to be desired. In particular, the first act of the film was disjointed and difficult to follow. The audience was thrown right into the middle with the suspected criminals, with little information given about their backstories or their connections to one another. As new characters were introduced, the plot became even more complex and convoluted, making it challenging to keep up with all the moving pieces. Once the film starts to conclude the second act, the pieces become a little more streamlined, which makes the back half of the movie much more enjoyable.\r\n\r\nIn terms of acting, the performances were a bit of a mixed bag. Some actors, such as Kevin Spacey and Gabriel Byrne, delivered grounded and impressive performances. However, other characters felt like overacted caricatures of quirky criminals, such as Benicio del Toro\'s character.\r\n\r\nOne of the main selling points of The Usual Suspects is its ""incredible"" twist ending. However, I personally saw it coming from a mile away, which was a bit disappointing. It\'s possible that the film\'s score may improve upon a second viewing, but for now, I can only give it three stars. That rating is primarily due to the strong technical aspects of the movie, as without those, it would likely only receive two-and-a-half stars.\r\n\r\nScore: 56% ⚠️\r\nVerdict: Decent', 'SUPERNATURAL THRILLER\r\nDirector Singer and writer McQuarrie won\'t admit that it\'s a supernatural thriller, and insist it\'s just the goofy Hollywood movie it appears to be at first, but a few viewings will let you know that it is indeed a supernatural thriller. \r\nThe story centers around five criminals who think they are gods, and therein lies the first clue to this being a sueprnatural thriller. Also, one of the men, Keaton, played by a Judd Hirsch look alike named Gabriel Byrne, is making a deal, along with his lawyer girlfriend, with some men in a high level restaurant. \r\nUpon a few viewings, you will realize that these men are not what they seem, because the lady lawyer eventually is seen making a ""deal with the devil"".\r\nThe ""devil"" is known to the five men as a character called ""Kaiser"". The allusions to Caesar (which the word ""kaiser"" comes from) is a biblical reference to a supernatural evil. \r\nYou will find out who the devil is when you realize that the biblical devil is incapable of telling the truth, and so everything he says is a lie. The five criminals all believe they can be ""better devils"". One of the five is actually a stand in for the female lawyer, for reasons you will know if you watch the film.', 'A true masterpiece of the crime genre! Five usual suspects are rounded up by the police to take part in an identity parade following a New York heist. It\'s clear that they had nothing to do with it, but when pitched together decide that they will avenge themselves on the NYPD. Their scheme progresses well until the intervention of international super-criminal ""Keyser Söze"" via his debonaire but menacing agent ""Mr. Kobayashi"" (a superb Pete Posthlethwaite) and soon it becomes clear that the police are not the only people who are the targets here. It\'s told in a clever, retrospective, narrative style with some great performances from Kevin Spacey and Gabriel Byrne that leaves us pondering just who is ""Söze"" and to deal with an ending that you""ll never forget!']"

That makes this film 100 years old! A century has gone by since it was made, released, and first viewed, and yet it’s still available to be appreciated anew today. The DVD print that I watched was in very good shape, the picture was great, and I felt that I was watching an important piece of cinema history.\r\n\r\nHowever, The Kid is by no means one of my favorite Chaplin films. In fact, two out of my top three aren’t even silent films, but prime examples of Chaplin’s later work: Monsieur Verdoux (1947) and Limelight (1952). And my third favorite, the 1936 masterpiece Modern Times, is only two-thirds silent!\r\n\r\nThe plot of the film is quite simple: our beloved Little Tramp finds another little tramp, and and raises the foundling as his own. Years pass, and together, they rise above their life of poverty through the power of love and comedy.\r\n\r\n“Professionally funny” is a phrase that I thought a fitting description of Chaplin. He was an artistic genius, and he knew what he was doing and how to engage an audience. In fact, this was his first feature-length film, and he took a whopping five-and-a-half months to shoot it, which was an incredible amount of time for a film production in 1921. Chaplin, of course, not only starred, but wrote, directed, produced, and scored the film!\r\n\r\nJackie Coogan was fantastic as “the Kid”, displaying a wide range of emotion and deftly tugging at the viewer’s heartstrings. His father, Jack Coogan, Sr., coached his son during filming and was paid $125 a week by Chaplin, and also played several small parts within the movie.\r\nChaplin and Coogan in The Kid (1921)\r\n\r\nIt is said that Chaplin and Coogan were as close off-screen as on, and every Sunday during the first few weeks of filming, Chaplin would take the boy to the amusement park or other fun activities. This relationship was seen as either an attempt on Chaplin’s part to reclaim his own unhappy childhood, or possibly he was just thinking about his own son whom he had lost, having died three days after birth.\r\n\r\nThe Kid features a truly bizarre dream sequence in which the Tramp falls asleep on his doorstep and dreams of everyone — including himself — as an angel or demon.\r\n\r\nHe envisions himself as an angel, with white, feathery wings spread out behind him, and a harp in his hand. Others, including a neighborhood bully, appear as demons, depicted traditionally in dark (presumably red) attire and horns atop their heads. Even a little dog, suspended on wires, comes floating by in a little angel costume!\r\n\r\nIt’s one of the strangest and most inexplicable dream sequences I’ve seen in a film, and yet it is oddly captivating.\r\n\r\nThe technical aspects in this film — both in the dream sequence and in the rest of the movie — are marvelous when one considers that it was made a hundred years ago, when the movie medium itself was less than thirty years old.\r\n\r\nWhether or not it is one of Chaplin’s greatest works is up to the individual viewer, but you cannot deny that it is a landmark movie, and holds an important place in the history of American cinema. It deserves a look, maybe even more than one. As the opening title card reads, it’s “a picture with a smile — and perhaps, a tear.”', ""An impoverished woman (Edna Purviance) feels compelled to abandon her child in the hope that he might find a better life - so she leaves him (with a short note) in the back of a car. The two men who find the little bundle don't want anything to do with him, so plonk him down behind some rubbish where de is discovered by the tramp (Charlie Chaplin). Now he's not that keen on children either, but the presence of an attentive policeman means can't just leave his new package in the pram of a woman nearby. Skip on five years and the two have become quite a formidable double act - the lad (Jackie Coogan) chucks stones at windows and his father-figure does the mending! Meantime, the mother finds success treading the boards and the boy's real father, likewise, succeeds - but that relationship is toast and she gradually starts to pine for and then search for her lost child. When the authorities cotton on to the lucrative acts of vandalism of the two, they attempt to seize the kid and put him in an orphanage - and that's when things all start to come to an head. There's a delightful bond that develops here between Chaplin and the enthusiastic young Coogan with Chaplin's direction showcasing both their skills and the extent of the poverty amidst which they lived and which drove people to make horrendous decisions to part with their children. The ending is exactly as it should be, so don't go expecting much jeopardy on that front - and the scenes with the angelic wings towards the end mix determination and comedy effectively, too. It makes you smile and pulls at the heart strings and is truly a classic piece of cinema.""]"

""Elisabeth"" (Liv Ullmann) is an acclaimed stage actress who, mid-performance, is struck dumb. Nobody is quite sure what has caused this, but a nurse is duly hired to take care of her. ""Alma"" (Bibi Andersson) arrives and soon comes to believe that the silence of her charge is her choice. She simply doesn\'t want to talk! Devoid of visitors, ""Alma"" constantly chatters to ""Elisabeth"" and a bond starts to develop between the two, outwardly profoundly different, women that challenges both of their preconceived ideas of the other. The latter is keen to emulate the former, the former is ultimately keen to prevent her new friend from doing precisely that. Why? What might have caused ""Elisabeth"" to take such an impenetrable refuge? Essentially this two hander is a monologue; there is precious little by way of contribution from anyone else as the characterisations intensify and the story becomes one of attrition, to an extent, but of cruelty - and of evaluating the sources and causes of cruelty, as well as providing us with a poignantly sensitive look at intimacy and maybe even optimism. I\'m certain that there are other depths and allegorical aspects to this that I didn\'t necessarily appreciate, but unlike with many of this director\'s films, I found the personas represented here to have more relevance and humanity that in many of his previous works. Coupled with the condensed nature of the storytelling, a strongly complementary score and some effective outdoor cinematography this makes for a compelling film to watch.']"

That\'s not to say it isn\'t a good film, nor that Al Pacino doesn\'t turn in a good effort - it\'s that it is all so brash. The language and action has no subtlety or finesse to it. It glorifies violence - it\'s not just that it is a necessary evil in the world in which ""Tony Montana"" works, it just comes across as if there was nothing in the script and the film had to be padded out somehow - so let\'s shove in some more brutality. There is precious little sophistication with the characterisation either - and after a while that all just grates. Top drawer production and scoring, though - and some fine supporting efforts from Robert Loggia and Steven Bauer but for me it was all just a bit in my face when just a little more effort and better scripting could have improved it no end. Good, but not great.', ""**A very violent film about drug trafficking and paranoia, with a great cast and a great production, but where everything is histrionic and exaggerated.**\r\n\r\nI caught this film yesterday on television and decided to watch it in full. I had already heard about it, and the good dramatic performance that Al Pacino had, and so I decided it was time to see for myself. Directed by Brian de Palma, it marked its time, but is currently somewhat forgotten. It's understandable: in addition to the gratuitous violence and the crudeness with which it approaches the topic of drug trafficking, we don't have any character here that we are capable of liking, and this puts a wall between the film and the viewer.\r\n\r\nBrian de Palma is a very solid director. Unfortunately, I didn't see as many of his films as I would have liked: I really liked “Carrie”, which for me is his masterpiece so far, and “Untouchables”. In this film, he did a very competent job, especially from a technical point of view, but the film has no soul and, after a while, it just seems like pure carnage. The chainsaw scene, as well as the final shootout, are worthy of an anthology.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film is impeccable and has luxurious production touches: the cinematography is beautiful, it highlights the sun and brightness of Florida very well and gives us a real feeling of the tropical climate. The sets and costumes not only fit well into the decade, but also manage to emphasize the characters' sense of nouveau riche and fast ascent. Of course, it's absurdly kitsch, even the soundtrack tells us that! However, we can't expect anything else from characters with no taste, no culture, no education and tons of money to show off! However, I will agree if someone tell me that the film is too long, with some scenes a bit incidental or unbelievable (that scene where Gina, enraged, gives herself sexually to her brother, was a good example). With little effort, about half an hour could have been removed from this film, making it more palatable.\r\n\r\nThe film's script is based on a remake of an original from 1932, which very few people know, and which was made by Howard Hughes. Perhaps the name of this film is slightly inspired by the figure of Al Capone, who had the unflattering nickname of “scarface”. In one of the most notable performances of his career, Al Pacino is histrionic, unpleasant and paranoid to the extreme. The intentional exaggeration may be off-putting, but it seems to be in line with a film where everything is exaggerated. However, I don't consider this to be one of the actor's best, I enjoyed seeing him in other roles. Robert Loggia and Steven Bauer provide very happy support, but Michelle Pfeiffer has little to do other than look sexy and vain. However, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and F. Murray Abraham have frankly underutilized characters.""]"

Vertigo was so strange already from the beginning because of its surreal and nightmarish atmosphere. I bow to Hitchcock in his creativity in visualizing Jimmy Stewart’s acrophobia by implementing one of the oldest cinematography techniques, using zoom lens as it zooms in while the object moves away, emphasizing his terrified feeling and insecurity whenever he’s at a particular height due to a chronic vertigo he suffers. As always, the film director’s cameo appearance has always been fascinating since we know it’s his habit therefore we will usually let our eyes wander throughout the film, trying to spot him. In conclusion, this timeless thriller remains a classic gem despite the emergence of new modern films. The great visual effects also seem timeless when compared to digital effects.

He does a stellar job with a difficult role.\r\n\r\nIn the supporting role of Stewart\'s faithful friend ""Midge"" is Barbara Bel Geddes, and she does a delightful job. \r\n\r\nAccording to one source I\'ve read, after Vertigo flopped upon release, Hitchcock blamed Stewart, claiming he (Stewart) was too old and people no longer wanted to see him, hence the film\'s lack of success.  When Hitchcock went on to do North By Northwest, Stewart reportedly begged Hitchcock for the lead role, but Hitchcock refused, giving the lead to Cary Grant, who was actually four years older than Stewart.\r\n\r\nBut according to a biography of Cary Grant written by Pamela Trescott, the reason Hitchcock wanted Grant instead was simply because they worked well together and had wanted to do another collaboration after the success of To Catch a Thief.  In short, that the lead role for North By Northwest had been intended for Cary Grant, and no one else, right from the beginning.  \r\n\r\nAll that aside, Vertigo has established a high reputation as a masterpiece of film, and rightly so.  It\'s also beautifully photographed, and the entire film has a soft, haunting, dreamy quality to it that\'s utterly captivating.', ""Not one of my favorites from Hitchcock, and certainly dower, but still visually striking and two amazing performances from James Stewart and Kim Novak.

Meantime, we also meet ""Colin"" (Matt Damon) who is in a mirror-image position with the State police.

If we add to the mix the fiery and determined detective ""Dignam"" (Mark Wahlberg) and a bit of love interest from ""Madolyn"" (Vera Farminga) and we get an engagingly complex thriller that unravels cleverly and slowly over 2½ hours generating a proper sense of menace. Nicholson is on superb form as the maniacal boss whom you just know probably isn\'t trustworthy - even for those his own side, and the focussed efforts from Leo and Damon deliver well to build the tension effectively. I liked the writing - and the paucity of it. There is comedy here, there is threat here but there is very little extraneous verbiage. The characters have a visceral quality to them that, as the story develops, really does immerse you in their tawdry and shady goings-on. I can\'t say that I loved the ending - somehow it seemed a little bit rushed, but there\'s certainly vindication there for someone... This is the kind of drama that thrives by knitting the myriad of threads together without having to faff about with timelines, loops, or repetition. It\'s a story that evolves in a plausibly hazardous yet characterful fashion and if you can catch it on a big screen, then it\'s highly recommended.

However, the acting performances are terrific, especially from Damon, whom I never really had much time for up until this film.\r\n\r\nI was also impressed by the performance of Will's girlfriend, played by Minnie Driver. She soon fell in love with him, only to find that he never reciprocated and pushed her away just as had done to other people who tried to get too close to him in the past.\r\n\r\nIt is very much a feel-good film with a nice satisfying ending. It pulls at the heartstrings sometimes, but you just know everything will work out right in the end."", ""So great!\r\n\r\n<em>'Good Will Hunting'</em> is a film I had heard many a great thing about but had never actually seen it so didn't know anything about the plot - so much so that I genuinely thought it was about the good will of hunting or something... and certainly not about a character named Will Hunting! The poster makes it look like a film of that sort, in my defence.\r\n\r\nI also didn't realise, aside from the lead two, that the cast list was so stacked until the credits came up at the start. The names didn't let me down either, as the acting is superb across the board. Matt Damon and Robin Williams are truly outstanding together, I already rate them from other productions so I'm glad I can add another cracker to their respective filmographies.\r\n\r\nEven away from Messrs Damon and Williams, you've got very good displays from the likes of Stellan Skarsgård, Minnie Driver (emotionally, particularly, excellent) and Ben Affleck. Pretty impressive that it was written by both Affleck and Damon too!\r\n\r\nThe plot is great, the way the friendship builds between Will (Damon) and Sean (Williams) is so beautifully done. Both characters are very interesting, even if I didn't buy the genius of Will at all at first but I quickly let that go as the film does such a grand job at crafting everything together around it.\r\n\r\nIn short, it's ace! Glad I finally checked it out."", '""Will"" (Matt Damon) is a rudderless character who works as a caretaker. He\'s an attitudinal pain in the neck whom, aside from his best friend ""Chuckie"" (Ben Affleck), is pretty much shunned by everyone. ""Professor Lambeau"" (Stellan Skarsgård) spots some potential in this wayward lad, especially when he realises that he has an amazing ability to solve mathematical problems. To that end he sends him to see the eccentric psychologist ""Sean"" (Robin Williams) who proves remarkably adept at cutting down the young man\'s defences and at beginning to rebuild the character of the man in a more positive and life-affirming fashion. The film combines some excellent performances from all four men, but especially a bang on-form Williams as the penetrative, but flawed, route to salvation for an equally flawed and angry almost younger version of himself in the genius ""Will"". Damon is entirely convincing as his temper and his prodigious nature are juggled adeptly and aided by a powerful script that allows the actors to take and keep centre stage as the potency of the plot becomes more and more focussed, we are presented here with a ground-breaking and thought-provoking look at what makes a great teacher as well as what makes a human being tick, what makes one happy and fulfilled - and what makes one the opposite! For my money, Gus Van Sant\'s finest interpretative work and well worth watching a few times, for more detail emerges to appreciate each time you see it.', ""**A very good film, but with some flaws and problems that deserve attention.**\r\n\r\nThis film is about a boy from Boston, who comes from very poor backgrounds, but who has a gift for mathematics, easily solving theorems and advanced problems that leave Harvard professors unanswered. He is discovered after solving one, at night and without telling anyone, and one of the professors at the university decides to help him be someone and make use of his gift. The problem is that he doesn't want to, he's not able to trust anyone, and he's seriously stuck with justice. Therefore, he will recruit an irreverent psychiatrist to try to help the boy.\r\n\r\nThe film's premise is very good, and the story has merits that we cannot ignore or minimize. It's one of those delicious movies to watch, that leaves us without feeling the time that passes. We really know that guy is not a bad person, but it's not easy to like the character due to his options and his bad social attitude. However, what bothered me the most was the construction of Robin Williams' character and his whole way of acting and accompanying that patient. I think anyone who has ever had the need to see a psychiatrist knows that they have strict rules about what they can and cannot do, and Williams' character breaks a good number of them.\r\n\r\nAnd this leads us to talk about actors. I really enjoyed Williams' work, but he is a long way from the best that the actor has given us. Matt Damon also did a good job, perhaps one of the best of his career, and one that opened more doors for him in his professional life. Stellan Skarsgard also intelligently took advantage of the opportunity to impose himself on the American cinematic scene, with a job well done and of great merit. Minnie Driver also did an interesting job, perhaps even more so than Ben Affleck, whose character doesn't have as much visibility or relevance.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film has many merits, starting with the excellent cinematography, a good set of sets and interesting costumes. The effects are understated, but they work quite well, and the soundtrack also does a pretty good job. It is not, however, a film that stands out for its technical aspects, nor could it be. The important thing in this film is the story it brings us and the work of the cast."", 'Psychological drama well in the beginning of Ben Aflleck and Matt Damon in their careers - they star (with Matt in the role of the protagonist) and wrote the script together. The director was Gus Van Sant (Drugstore Cowboy).\r\n\r\nThe movie tells a story about a irish-descendant boy in Boston that works as janitor in a mathematics faculty, and it is a self-taught genius, with a troubled past and present - some  mathematical riddles are left by the head of the chair in the faculty (Skarsgård) and mysteriously solved by night. Catching up with Matt Damon character Will he can be out of parole if he gets a job and consult with a psychiatrist what shows to be a tid bit tough thing. \r\n\r\nThe film received positive reviews from critics and grossed over $225 million during its theatrical run against a $10 million budget, and received nominations in nine categories, including Best Picture and Best Director, and won in two: Best Supporting Actor for Williams and Best Original Screenplay for Affleck and Damon. Nothing bad, at all for someone being just out of Harvard University. Anther curiosity: character Skylar in the movie have the same name and background of Matt Damon\'s girlfriend back then.\r\n\r\nRobin Williams acts as the psychiatrist that could connect with this troubled boy, in a solid role - speaking of solid role it was nice to see Matt Damon out of some action movie in really nice drama scenes. Another actor that shows up is Stellan Skarsgård, yes the father of the four sons the most known being Bill (of ""It""). \r\n\r\nNice heartwarming moving movie thought the end with a solid script. I would scorre it a 8.0 out of 10.0 / B+. It is strange that I didn\'t even reminded this one back in 97, but then I remembered that that year I was in the 3rd year of Medicine so not much time to seeing movies I guess.']"

(And I\'m a fan of the ""Star Trek"" universe!) The claustrophobic feel of the ""Nostromo"" is due to ""filming inside of a tube"" location shooting next seen in ""Das Boot."" \r\n\r\nA band of ""space truckers"" are awakened from hibernation, and are shocked to find that they are only half way home. The Company orders them to investigate an Alien transmission, which sets up a descent into Hell as the crew finds themselves being stalked by an opportunistic ""Exomorph."" As the crew is picked off one by one, the true nature of the beast and the odd attitude of the Science officer, Ash, raise the anxiety level over 100%.\r\n\r\nWhat sets this tale apart from other ""space monster"" films is the character of Third officer Ripley, who raises uncomfortable questions to Capt. Dallas about company policy in general and Science officer Ash in particular. After Capt. Dallas disappears, take-charge-female-Ripley discovers Ash\'s true intentions and leads her diminished crew to action.\r\n\r\n The level of violence has been described as ""near pornographic,"" which is helped along by H.R. Giger\'s ""worst nightmare"" mature Alien. This is the first of a memorable franchise, featuring a strong female leader that continues into the ""Prometheus"" prequel.(?)', ""There is a clause in the contract which specifically states any systematized transmission indicating a possible intelligent origin must be investigated... \r\n\r\nAlien is directed by Ridley Scott and written by Ronald Shusett and Dan O'Bannon. It stars Tom Skerritt, Sigourney Weaver, Veronica Cartwright, John Hurt, Yaphet Kotto, Ian Holm and Harry Dean Stanton. Music is by Jerry Goldsmith and cinematography by Derek Vanlint.\r\n\r\nThe space merchant vessel Nostromo receives an unknown transmission as a distress call and land on the moon where the call had come from. Bad idea...\r\n\r\nBack on release it was one of the most talked about movies of 1979, backed by a  terrifically tantalising trailer - which itself was backed by one of the greatest tag-lines of them all, the weight of expectation of a genre blending classic was colossal. This was only after all director Ridley Scott's second feature length film, could a sophomore pic really be all that? History as we now know has proven that to be the case.\r\n\r\nOn plot synopsis it's standard format, where the haunted house and a killer on the loose has been replaced by a space ship in space. Yet once the pic plays its alien hand, and it becomes a battle of survival in one location, it dawns on you there is really no escape. No running into the garden and down the street, no hiding in the attic hoping the killer saunters off home, this is find and destroy or be destroyed yourself - with the future of mankind depending on the humans to succeed.\r\n\r\nSome still go into a viewing of Alien nowadays and decry it for being too much of a slow burn, yet this is one of the pic's biggest assets. Time in space is slow anyway, and lonely one would guess, so Scott wisely lets the characters be introduced, lets us understand just enough about their psychological make up before things go belly up (literally as it happens). When the pot finally boils over it's terrifying, the bar well and truly raised for horror/sci-fi hybrid  conventions.\r\n\r\nWith art design by H.R. Giger and Goldsmith producing eerie musical rumbles, the whole piece has a disquiet about it, notably with distressing sexual connotations and symbolism that haunts the mind as the body horror unfolds. The quiet passages are nerve shredders, Alien across the board is a visceral experience, especially for those who have ever watched it on a big screen in a darkened theatre.\r\n\r\nIt made a star of Weaver, who unbeknown to those on first viewing is the main character, another masterstroke by Scott, with Ripley the character in Weaver's hands shunting women's character's in big budget films forward by some considerable margin. All the cast are on great form, there's no showy stars in here, a collection of hard working British and American actors feeding off their director for super returns.\r\n\r\nNow 40 years old, Alien shows no sign of losing its classic status, and rightly show. A seminal class act that still holds all the qualities it had back in 1979. In space no one can hear you scream - indeed! 10/10"", ""The standard bearer of horror in space, Ridley Scott's masterpiece still thrills new generations of fans. The Giger-inspired alien induces a claustrophobic nightmare that still carries on in sequels and prequels."", ""<em>'Alien'</em> isn't as eventful, and as such as entertaining, as I had anticipated, though it is still an enjoyable near two hours.\r\n\r\nIt's a strong cast, with newbie Sigourney Weaver putting in a great performance. Tom Skerritt, Harry Dean Stanton, Yaphet Kotto and John Hurt are good too. I wanted to see more of them, though that's normal given the tightness of the setting - there's only so much they can do, of course.\r\n\r\nOther positives include the neat set design, solid special effects and well done tension building. I can't say I was ever fully unnerved, in fairness that's more a personal thing as fiction rarely scares me, but I was locked on for the entirety. It also gets respect for setting the benchmark it did.\r\n\r\nWill check out the sequels, prequels and spin-offs/crossovers with much intrigue."", ""Horror in Space, that's what this is. It's a space monster movie, and the thing is, if you see Aliens, or most of the other Alien related films BEFORE you see this one, you're going to be expecting something completely different.\r\n\r\nBut what you have is a horror movie set on a space ship with an atmosphere so thick that you could cut it with a knife.\r\n\r\nYou can taste the eerie tension when you watch it...and, at least in my eyes, that makes it better than the over-the-top Space Marines that you see in the later installments.\r\n\r\nAnd, no questions are answered. There is no broad sweeping mythology. There is only the movie, there is only the monster, there is only the fear and tension. But that is all the movie needs.\r\n\r\nIt's just science-fiction and scary. It's a brilliant merger.\r\n\r\nBut, don't listen to the people making it out to be more than it is. It's really ONLY a horror movie in space and nothing more. That doesn't make it any less enjoyable, but it does make it completely confusing when you read reviews that make it out to be more than an exceptional monster movie."", ""**One of the great founders of modern sci-fi.**\r\n\r\nAnyone who knows me already knows that I don't really like alien-themed movies, because I don't strictly believe in intelligent life outside our planet. However, the theme has already yielded many quality horror or thriller films. “Alien” is arguably the best, best-performed, and most enshrined and culturally significant of them all. It's one of those films that has already gone beyond cinematic issues to become a piece of art and culture that we all know, even people who never took the time to see it.\r\n\r\nThus, it is not worth wasting time explaining the plot around the “Nostromo”, a cargo ship with seven crew members who are decimated by a highly dangerous and carnivorous alien. The direction, in charge of Ridley Scott, is excellent, meticulous, attentive, and the story is intelligent, very well written and with well-developed and used characters. Contrary to what happens in other films, we see the characters trying to act as a team, and trying to solve an unexpected and dangerous situation. I never felt like they were acting in such a way as to almost purposefully put themselves in danger, which happens a lot in recent horror movies.\r\n\r\nSigourney Weaver made an excellent dramatic career after this film, which established her as an actress and opened doors for her in the industry. A deserved reward, given that she puts in her best efforts and gives this character all the resilience, humanity and charisma she deserves and needs. Despite the general quality of the cast being quite good, there are almost no actors capable of matching Weaver. As far as the technical aspects are concerned, the film has excellent cinematography (it even looks newer than it is) and really good special effects and visuals, considering that there is no CGI and that everything is done in the old-fashioned way. Finally, a word of praise for the iconic original score composed by Jerry Goldsmith."", 'Back in the day before Sir John Hurt took to being little more than a highly paid cameo-man, he was a great actor and here is a prime example. His merchant ship is travelling through space when it receives a distress call. They stop to help and one of their number becomes infected with a... well, now you have to watch it. Sigourney Weaver is superb as the feisty, no-nonsense ""Ripley"" who leads the defence against a beastie that has brute strength, determination, intelligence and an astonishing ability to move at speed through the corridors and conduits of the ship. Ridley Scott allows the tension to rise gently and violently, by degree, and the clever use of sound and light; Jerry Goldsmith\'s tense score and excellent supporting performances from Tom Skerritt and a wonderfully seedy ian Holm make this a seminal sci-fi horror film that still makes you want to hide behind the sofa - 40 years on!', 'The baby xenomorph looks like a muppet.', 'A masterpiece!\r\n\r\nCan be rewatched indefinitely!', ""This is a classic for a reason. It's one of those movies where technical flaws are completely overshadowed by the story and the atmosphere.""]"

The top-notch cast is, I think, a big part of what makes this film so memorable, and much-heralded through the years.  The script is truly well-written and moving.  My only complaint is, how could they do something so awful as killing off Peter Lorre within the first quarter of the film?\r\n\r\nWould I recommend?  Overall, yes.

Over the years it has become one of the most quoted ever pictures (sometimes wrongly), and in reality it\'s arguably more iconic than it is a work of art. Although a truly ""A"" list production for 1942, fact is nobody in and around the film expected it to be anything other than a good piece that will put bums on the seats in the theatres. Solidly received on release and riding in on the wave of the Allies inroads into North Africa, Casablanca steadily overcame the much discussed production troubles (the script was practically rewritten daily) to be where it is now, one of the most loved film\'s of all time.\r\n\r\nI wouldn\'t mention Paris, it\'s poor salesmanship!\r\n\r\nSo what is it about Casablanca that makes it so cherished and adored by each and every generation?. I just know that each time I view it (yearly) it\'s like falling in love again, each viewing brings a new and emotionally driven fulfilment. Tears flow, sad ones and happy ones, an overriding feeling that romantic idealism isn\'t dead, to which Casablanca becomes my personal myth buster. Thematic redemption brings a joyous reward, even as our daydreams about lost chances and lost loves hangs heavy in and around Rick\'s Café Américain. Everything about Casablanca is right, from the flawless direction (Michael Curtiz) to the iconic music, and of course the magnificent characters that are brought to life by the incredibly tight and effective cast. It may not be the greatest film of all time, but to me, and those who let it into their lives, it\'s one of the best friends anyone could ever hope to have. 10/10', 'I\'ve just seen this on a big screen for the first time in over thirty years - no enhancements, 4K, HD - just as Michael Curtiz saw it back in 1942 and it\'s a cracking piece of cinema. ""Rick Blaine"" (Humphrey Bogart) runs his Casablanca café as a literal oasis in the North African desert - a refuge for all sorts fleeing the oppression of the Nazis in nearby Europe. Enter ""Ilsa"" (Ingrid Bergman) and her husband, a Czech resistance leader ""Hector Lazlo"" (Paul Henried) and we discover that ""Rick"" and her have a past, and when the pursuing ""Maj. Strasser"" (Conrad Veidt) and local police chief Claude Rains (""Capt. Renault"") get involved in this cocktail of deceit and duplicity things gradually come to the boil in a wonderfully evocative, sophisticated fashion. Bogart and Bergman positively smoulder; the chemistry is electric - she, as usual, doesn\'t actually act - she is just herself, and that\'s all she needs to do. Rains is great as the conniving policeman as is Veidt delivering the rather sparse, but no less potent, dialogue perfectly. Like most of the best films, the key to this is it\'s (seemingly effortless) simplicity - and this one also has a wonderful musical score to complement the tensely directed, eerily shot, story augmented by an hugely talented supporting cast with the likes of Peter Lorre and the superbly sleazy Sydney Greenstreet. There was a great deal wrong and inhibiting with the ""studio system"" that prevailed at the time, but when it did work it could pull together an astonishing collection of people in front of, and behind the camera and create masterpieces like this.', ""**One of the best movies of all time.**\r\n\r\nUnlike some people, I believe that there are perfect movies. It doesn't happen easily, but they do exist, and I'm pretty sure this is one of them. A classic in its own right, which has withstood the test of time and continues to win sympathies today, it is one of the most outstanding films in American cinema, a work that goes beyond aesthetics, art and culture, and which, over the decades, became part of the collective memory, part of the universal cultural heritage.\r\n\r\nThe film was made in 1942, in the midst of World War II, and its production was conditioned by severe restrictions on the use of raw materials considered important for the American war effort. So many of the sets are recycled, they were used in a number of other Warner films and adapted here. Another direct consequence that the war brought to this film is the huge amount of real refugees that made up the technical team and the extras, and who are deeply emotionally moved in that famous scene where the French anthem, sung with all their lungs, completely drowns out the chorus of German officers while singing a patriotic march.\r\n\r\nThe script brings us a love story: Rick and Ilsa meet and fall in love quickly in Paris. However, after a few days, the arrival of the victorious Germans in the city forces them to flee, and makes her decide to end the romance. Years later, Rick finds himself established with a bar in the city of Casablanca, in a part of Morocco controlled by the Free France, and where many refugees drink, gamble and seek the money necessary to pay the passes and visas that the authorities demand to be able to go to Portugal, a neutral country where they can, if they wish, head to the United States. It is there that the two lovers end up meeting again, in the midst of a plot that also includes a corrupt French officer, a ruthless German officer and two stolen passes, which everyone seems to want.\r\n\r\nThe cast is elegantly led by two of the biggest stars of their time: on the one hand, the heartthrob Humphrey Bogart, with his characteristic voice and pose, impeccable in one of the most complete and powerful works of his career. He knew perfectly how to give his character a pleasant dose of cynicism, self-centeredness and disenchantment. On the other hand, the beautiful and intelligent Ingrid Bergman in one of her life's works. The film also has good performances by several supporting actors, such as Peter Lorre, Sydney Greenstreet, Conrad Veidt and also Paul Henreid and Claude Rains.\r\n\r\nTechnically, we have great praise for the masterful direction of Michael Curtiz, who had the wisdom to give the film the pace, ambience and elegance it needed to be able to flourish and marvel. With discreet production values \u200b\u200band an effort to contain expenses, the film still never feels cheap, and there's never a moment where we can say that we didn't have money to buy a certain prop, to improve a specific set or costume. The cinematography works very well, and the filming work seems to have been impeccable, with some strategic and well-positioned zooms marking the most dramatic scenes and the juiciest dialogues. The soundtrack doesn't have very resonant themes, but it's impossible to forget “As Time Goes By” after we've seen this film.""]"

They told me: ""I\'m not happy to be here."" ""Why am I here when there\'__s no one to take care of me?"" ""Why am I here if I\'m going to be hungry all the time?"" They have the feeling that they\'re here because they are being punished for something._\r\n\r\n- Nadine Labaki; _Capharnaüm_ Production Notes\r\n\r\nTaking as its subject the horrific plight of guttersnipe children in the slums of Beirut, _Capharnaüm_ is the kind of film of which a superficial reading might suggest miserablism at best, and ""poverty porn"" at worst. Comparisons to film such as Danny Boyle\'s _Slumdog Millionaire_ (2008), Stephen Daldry\'s _Trash_ (2014), and Sean Baker\'s _The Florida Project_ (2017) are probably inevitable, albeit not very informative if one wishes to parse the film. Instead, it\'s much more useful to view _Capharnaüm_ in the tradition of classic Italian neorealist pictures such as Luchino Visconti\'s _Ossessione_ (1943) and _La Terra Trema_ (19548), Roberto Rossellini\'s _Roma città aperta_ (1945) and _Germania anno zero_ (1948), and Vittorio De Sica\'s _Ladri di biciclette_ (1948) and _Umberto D._ (1952), albeit far more pessimistic than any of them.\r\n\r\nThe third film from Lebanese writer/actress/director Nadine Labaki (_Caramel_; _Where Do We Go Now?_), _Capharnaüm_ is written by Labaki, Michelle Keserwany, and Labaki\'s regular writing partner Jihad Hojaily (Georges Khabbaz, Labaki\'s husband, and the film\'s producer and composer, Khaled Mouzanar are credited with ""screenplay collaboration""). Presenting a _milieu_ in which people are utterly discardable, the film depicts children who are literally bought and sold for a few chickens; 11-year-old girls who are married off so their family can afford the rent; babies who are fed on ice cubes covered in sugar; refugees who roam the streets; mental illness which goes untreated; and people without a Lebanese identity card who don\'t officially exist. Uplifting it most certainly is not. In a similar tonal key to Héctor Babenco\'s _Pixote: a Lei do Mais Fraco_ (1981) and Walter Salles\'s _Central do Brasil_ (1998), the film works because it never feels like it\'s exploiting, patronising, or trivialising the poverty and misfortune it depicts, never attempting to manipulate the audience into feeling a preconceived emotion. On the contrary, it\'s matter-of-fact, and notable for just how unsentimental it is. However, it\'s also deeply humanist, with genuine compassion in its DNA and a quiet rage at its core, born partly from an inherent sense of authenticity; shot in the style of _cinéma vérité_, it uses non-professional actors whose lives are not dissimilar from the characters they play, with Labaki encouraging improvisation throughout. There are some problems, of course - the framing device of a trial is poorly conceived and distracts from the superior filmmaking surrounding it, the ending is disappointingly didactic, and the litany of hardships endured by the main character does get a little over-the-top. However, this is undeniably impressive filmmaking, as harrowing and angry, as it is solicitous and respectful.\r\n\r\nZain El Hajj (Zain Al Rafeea) is a young boy from the slums of Beirut serving a five-year prison sentence for, as he puts it, ""_stabbing a son-of-a-bitch_."" Neither he nor his parents, mother Souad (Kawsar Al Haddad) and father Selim (Fadi Youssef), know Zain\'s exact age, as he was never officially registered, and therefore has no birth cert. As the film begins, Zain is brought before a judge, as he has decided to sue his parents for bringing him into the world despite not being able to care for their already numerous children. The film then flashes back several months, with Zain working as a delivery boy for the family\'s landlord, Assad (Nour El Husseini). Life is harsh, but Zain and his sister, 11-year-old sister Sahar (Haita ""Cedra"" Izzam), look out for one another. When he sees bloodstains on her underwear, he helps her hide the fact that she has begun her period, believing their parents might try to marry her off. Making plans to escape with her, Zain returns home one day to find his parents in the process of handing Sahar over to Assad. A brutal struggle ensues, but Zain fails to save her, and that night, he runs away. Seeking refuge in a rundown amusement park, he meets Rahil (Yordanos Shiferaw), an Ethiopian refugee working as a cleaner. Taking pity on Zain, she agrees to let him stay with her in exchange for him looking after her one-year-old son Yonas (an absolutely astounding performance by Boluwatife Treasure Bankole) when she\'s at work. Her forged migrant documents are set to expire soon and as she doesn\'t have enough money to pay her forger, Aspro (Alaa Chouchnieh), for new papers, he is trying to persuade her to sell him Yonas. As time passes, Zain, Rahil, and Yonas form a tight bond, until one day, Rahil doesn\'t return home from work, leaving Zain and Yonas to fend for themselves.\r\n\r\nThoroughly uplifting stuff, am I right? Labaki first got the idea for the film when she saw a woman and a one-year-old baby on a traffic island in Beirut. In the film\'s production notes, Labaki writes,\r\n\r\n> _the little boy couldn\'t sleep. Every time he would doze off, he would wake up again. And it hit me. The only place where this kid is going to experience life is this half a meter of concrete between two highways. It\'s all he knows._\r\n\r\nWhen she got home, she drew a picture of a child shouting at a group of adults, with the caption,\r\n\r\n> _I\'m sorry! I quit! I don\'t want to be here! I don\'t belong in your world! I don\'t want to breathe, eat, play, learn, laugh or dream! I don\'t want to grow up to become like you! You have failed me!_\r\n\r\nBrainstorming, she began to write down everything that bothered her about the situation;\r\n\r\n> _where did the system fail these kids? Why do we as a society allow this sort of injustice to happen? The migrant workers\' situation in Lebanon; the absurdity of the notion of frontiers; the absurdity that you need a paper to prove that you exist._\r\n\r\nLooking at the list of topics, she thought of the French word, ""_Capharnaüm_"" (alternatively spelt Capernaum). The term was originally the name of a Biblical fishing village on the northern shore of the Sea of Galilee, which is mentioned multiple times across all four gospels, as a place where Jesus performed several miracles. However, it\'s best known from Matthew 11:23, when Jesus curses the village for its lack of faith in him (""_And you, Capernaum, will you be lifted to the heavens? No, you will go down to Hades. For if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Sodom, it would have remained to this day_""). Later on, however, the word came to be used in French literature to signify a state of chaos and disorder. The current dictionary definition is, ""_a confused jumble; a place marked by a disorderly accumulation of objects_"".\r\n\r\nBeginning to research what life is really like for children of poverty, Labaki went to prisons for minors, refugee camps, courtrooms, and the streets themselves. Shooting with as small a crew as possible, she elected to use a non-professional cast whose lives resembled those of the character they\'re playing (like Rahil, Shiferaw is an illegal Ethiopian immigrant who was working as a cleaner; like Sahar, Izzam was unable to attend school in Lebanon, and was selling gum on the street; like Souad, Haddad has children for whom she has been unable to get ID). In this sense, casting director Jennifer Haddad deserves a great deal of praise, as she\'s done an astounding job of pulling together an authentic ensemble. During the shoot, Labaki would give the performers the basic outline of a scene, but allow them to use their own words and mannerisms, and draw upon their own experiences, without worrying too much about where the scene is supposed to go. With the film being shot in sequence, this necessitated that the script was constantly being rewritten, so as to accommodate something which somebody had improvised.\r\n\r\nFrom an aesthetic perspective, Labaki wisely keeps things simple and functional, eschewing any directorial gymnastics, with the aesthetic design perfectly chosen to convey the story she wishes to tell. Adopting a documentarian sense of realism, cinematographer Christopher Aoun sticks to handheld cameras and, for the most part, natural lighting. The scenes on the streets of Beirut are especially impressive, with Labaki shooting most of the material from roughly Zain\'s height, or slightly lower. This allows the scenes to adopt a heavily focalised and subjective view of the world, without having to resort to less elegant POV shots. Chadi Roukoz\'s sound design is also superb in these exterior scenes, with the soundtrack crammed with car horns, shouting, crying, laughter, dogs barking, airplanes flying overhead, traffic on the streets. It\'s an aural overload, conveying how the massive city is overwhelming Zain, and again, tying us to his subjectivity.\r\n\r\nLaure Gardette (_Jeune & Jolie_; _Frantz_) and Konstantin Bock\'s editing is also laudable. Even apart from the fact that they had to cull the film from over 500 hours of footage (the first cut ran 12 hours), with the complete editing process taking over two years, the editing is extremely powerful in certain scenes, with the specific cuts tied closely to the theme and tone of the film. Probably the two best examples are the scene where Zain is trying to prevent his parents from giving Sahar to Assad, and a later scene when Zain leaves Yonas on the side of the road and tries to walk away. The fight for Sahar balances, on the one hand, combinations of shots focusing on Sahar and the parents, and on the other, an equal number of shots focused solely on Zain. This places him front-and-centre in the _mise en scène_, simply by virtue of the fact that we see more of him than any of the other characters. The result is that the scene, although ostensibly concerned with the parents\' choice to give Sahar away, is actually more about Zain\'s reaction to that choice. Similarly, in the scene where he tries to leave Yonas, the editing focuses on him rather than the baby - the shots of Zain are longer, there are more of them, and there are a combination of different framings, whereas all of the shots of Yonas are uniform. This kind of editing is as shrewd as it is subtle, giving Zain a greater sense of agency and energy, and ensuring the audience knows that he, not Yonas, should be the focus of our attention.\r\n\r\nLabaki sets the tone for the film to come in the very first shot, as we see Zain, filthy dirty, in only his vest and underwear. It is subsequently driven home multiple times that life is almost worthless in this place - Sahar is sold for some chickens, Aspro tries to get Rahil to sell Yonas in return for forged migrant documents, Assad tells Zain, ""_I can buy a human for 500_"". This is a world in which people think of children in the same way as they think of commodities, with the notion of adults protecting children subservient to that of adults looking at children in a cold transactional manner. In such a place, Zain somehow manages to retain his sense of empathy, although he too is infected with the concept that everything is transactional, as his pragmatism illustrates to him that materialism is the order of the day. However, although he suppresses his sense of compassion, he does not completely extinguish it, nor would he want to. In a world where adults are reprehensible, and children their innocent victims, Zain is the story\'s moral compass, exhibiting a humanity far in excess of any kindness than has ever been shown to him.\r\n\r\nThematically, Zain\'s jaded disillusionment, which is far more pronounced than it should ever be in a child his age, echoes the line from _Ladri di biciclette_, when Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorani) decries, ""_I curse the day I was born._"" Zain himself is kind of an amalgamation of Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre Léaud) from François Truffaut\'s _Les quatre cents coups_ (1959), Huckleberry Finn, and any number of Charles Dickens youngsters (Oliver Twist, David Copperfield, Little Dorrit, Philip Pirrip, aka Pip), with his unique perspective on the world illuminating the horrors of that world in a way that would be impossible were he an adult. An important plot point in relation to Zain is his lack of an ID card. Without being registered when he was born, he can\'t get a state ID, meaning he is effectively a non-person; he cannot own a passport, he cannot legally work, and he is not entitled to an education or medical care, a situation that attains an almost Kafka-esque surrealism in its bureaucratic absurdity.\r\n\r\nIn terms of problems, there are a few. The framing device of the trial, for example, is awkwardly realised, and for the most part, serves only to interrupt the far more compelling story of Zain, Rahil, and Yonas. Additionally, not only do the scenes in court come across as more heavily scripted than everything else, but they also depict something that couldn\'t happen (as Labaki herself has acknowledged, children can\'t sue their parents for giving birth to them). Obviously intended as a means to dramatize how Zain wants a voice, it is nonetheless a narrative contrivance that gets in the way of the far more accomplished filmmaking seen elsewhere. Surrounded by the more naturalistic realism of the rest of the film, the court scenes stand out because they feel like a plot machination. The third act in particular, which focuses primarily on the trial, and which features the usual impassioned speeches you would get in any clichéd courtroom drama, strays into something Labaki has deftly avoid everywhere else; didacticism. Elsewhere, there is something of a sense that Labaki overloads the story, pushing just one too many hardships on Zain, as she attempts to cover a plethora of topics. For example, she touches on domestic violence, the migrant crisis, human trafficking, paedophilia, child labour, education, the justice system, and on occasion, the film feels like it\'s going to collapse under the weight of human suffering and thematic nihilism. This is a shame because some of the best scenes in the film are those involving Zain and Yonas just going about their day, and if Labaki had had the confidence in these quieter moments, she might have scaled back on the socio-political content.\r\n\r\nIn a strange way, _Capharnaüm_ has something of the same thematic DNA as Paul Schrader\'s _First Reformed_ (2017), with both films examining the morality of bringing children into a world of suffering (albeit from fundamentally different perspectives, with Schrader\'s examination far more existential than Labaki\'s practical workaday world). Never feeling exploitative, nor glorifying the poverty at its centre, the film isn\'t even especially sentimental, depicting scenes with a raw matter-of-factness, that were they featured in a Hollywood movie would be in slow-motion, with string music telling us to ""Cry now"". Zain is no saint; he\'s a rough, foul-mouthed thief, but he\'s also the most inherently honourable character in the film. Labaki could easily have used Zain to attempt to elicit unearned pity, but instead, she is far more interested in examining the day-to-day survival of children like him. One of his most salient characterises is his practical-minded solutions to the challenges he faces, and in this, we\'re encouraged to respect how he responds to his situation rather than pity him for being in such a situation in the first place. The film adopts something of the same manner; much like Zain, it\'s tough-minded and practical, and just as his hardened exterior is completely authentic, so too is the film\'s quiet anger. Placing us not just in Zain\'s world, but, crucially, in his subjective interpretation of that world, Labaki draws us to him, allowing us to view the world partly as outraged adults, but also as sharers in his experiences. The conclusion is disappointingly didactic, and the journey there harrowing and exhausting. However, in the last shot, Labaki dares to offer a very cautious bit of optimism, and ultimately, the takeaway is not despair, but compassion. Just as Zain finds a humanity within himself that should be long dead, the film finds a moment of optimism amidst the chaos, and encourages the audience to cling to it.']"

On that note, happy to read that director Denis Villeneuve has noted that he won't be rushing that one out - and rightly so!"", 'This is certainly a great looking film to see on a big screen with some really effective, almost industrially sounding, audio - but what happened to the story? It\'s wafer thin and really stretched out for 2¾ hours. We pick up with ""Paul"" (Timothée Chalamet) and his mother (Rebecca Ferguson) trying to convince the ""Fremen"" that they are worth the hassle. Fortunately, leader ""Stilgar"" (Javier Bardem) is convinced of the messianic state of the young refugee, whilst their own reverend mother is on her last legs which might give ""Jessica"" a chance to prove her own worth, and provide an opportunity to peddle some embellished mythology about her son\'s ascendant propheteering. All of this manoeuvring and politicking is having quite an impact on ""Chani"" (the under-used Zendaya) and on the relationship between her and the increasingly worshipped new Duke. Meantime, now fully reinvigorated and emerged from his bath of recuperative Guinness, the evil ""Baron Harkonnen"" (an almost Zeppelin-like Stellan Skarsgård) has recruited his lethal nephew ""Feyd-Rautha"" (Austin Butler) to get to grips with the rebellion on ""Arrakis"" that is bringing him into the gaze of an ill-satisfied emperor (Christopher Walken). Battle lines are drawn! Now whilst I did enjoy this, the rest of the film is a gloriously photographed but slowly paced hybrid of ""Khartoum"" (1966) and ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (1962) with a bit of the ""Phantom Menace"" (1999) thrown in for good measure. The acting is adequate but the characterisations are all too routinely sacrificed at the altar of the stunning visuals and from about an hour to go, I was convinced this this was but part two of three (or maybe even more). Walken and Charlotte Rampling feature all too sparingly to make much difference, indeed even Zendaya\'s warrior-like tendencies seem to have been neutered rather and I though that Chalamet just tried far too hard to imbue his character with a strength that he was far more successful with first time round.

However, when the first part of this story was released in 2021, I was sorely disappointed by this tedious, overlong slog that, despite its stunning visuals and cinematography, never really engaged me. Though, for all my disappointment with the initial installment, it can’t begin to compare to my reaction to “Part Two” – an even more tedious, unengaging, overly complicated offering that had me bored by 20 minutes in. I found myself not caring a whit about the characters or their story (which could have used a scorecard to help viewers sort out everything), and even the supposedly superior visuals of this iteration failed to capture my attention or interest. I can only conclude that I must be missing something, given the generally positive reactions and accolades this film and its predecessor have received, but I’m mystified that I haven’t yet figured out what. By all rights, the elements would appear to be in place here to make this picture succeed – a stellar cast, great special effects and the skillful directing of filmmaker Denis Villeneuve, who created such excellent works as “Arrival” (2016) and “Blade Runner 2049” (2017) – but “Part Two,” like its predecessor, just never grabbed me. To be honest, I’m truly surprised that I made it all the way through, considering the nearly constant temptation to want to fast-forward through the egregiously dull sequences (of there were many). From all this, I can only surmise that this film and the one that preceded it were created simply to milk as much box office money as possible out of the source material, despite the fact that the story isn’t captivating enough to live up to that challenge. Indeed, if you’re like me and found the first part boring, you’ll probably find this one even more tiresome and lackluster (I’m certainly glad that I waited for this one to come to streaming and didn’t waste my money on theater ticket prices). And now, as I understand it, another sequel, “Dune: Messiah,” is in pre-production to continue a story that has still yet to reach conclusion after more than five hours of screentime. Be aware that the “Dune” films are far from the quality of other lengthy trilogies like the “Lord of the Rings” and “Dark Knight” series, films that definitely hold viewer interest from start to finish. Instead, “Dune” and “Dune: Part Two” are more like such mind-numbing stand-alone offerings as “Heaven’s Gate” (1980), “Ishtar” (1987) and “Tenet” (2020) than anything of a genuinely epic nature. Treat the hype for this one with a hefty grain of salt, and don’t say you weren’t warned.', 'This is the greatest Science Fiction film ever made.

There\'s one, maybe two, good songs that I had already heard, while Gene Kelly (Don) is solid fun in the lead role.

Given it\'s a musical, though, they don\'t delve as deep into that as I wanted.\r\n\r\nNone of the songs, aside from the previously alluded to ""Singin\' in the Rain"", landed well with me, I kinda found them a chore to sit through to be frank.

Jean Hagen (Lina) is likewise a tad annoying, though that\'s intentional with her to be fair.\r\n\r\nI will acknowledge that the film, aesthetically, looks excellent. I wish I liked it more overall, but I just didn\'t. Do feel free to ignore me!', 'There\'s a tendency with this film to just think of the genius that was Gene Kelly and his umbrella with the title song, but as a wonderfully enjoyable three hander between himself, Debbie Reynolds and my own favourite from this film Donald O\'Connor, it is so much more the that. It just oozes charm and style. The plot centres around the aspirations of a silent movie company to make a talkie! Their long established stars ""Don Lockwood"" (Kelly) and ""Lina Lamont"" (Jean Hagan) have a successful on-screen (and in-press) persona as the dream couple - in reality they can barely stomach each other - but they must embrace progress and with the arrival of the sound equipment and new ideas man ""Cosmo"" (O\'Connor) the challenge is on to make a smash hit. Anyone who\'s seen any silent movies will know that not everyone successful in that medium had the, shall we say - attributes - to make a go of this, and soon we have a bit of a battle going on between Hagan and Kelly\'s actual gal in this movie ""Kathy"" (Reynolds) for the big part! The settings allow the costumier to have a field day, and the three are very much in their elements trying out all these would-be scenarios from the creative head of ""Cosmo"". Songs? Well, where do you start? Betty Comden and Adolph Green hit a real purple patch with his - they trawled through musicals from the twenties and thirties and present us with the likes of ""You Were Meant For Me"", ""Make \'em Laugh"" and ""Good Morning"" as well as the theme song that get our feet a-tapping and our smiles a-raising. Reynolds\' singing voice came courtesy of Betty Noyes, but the dubbing is perfect and it matters not a jot that she isn\'t actually singing. There is plenty of light-heartedness (and a healthy dose of jealous back-biting too!) and the dancing isn\'t perfect, which helps lots too. For much of the time, the routines look and feel natural, like pals making it up as they go along and having fun in the process.

What can he do, though? Every attempt to ""escape"" is thwarted and we know he is terrified of the water... Will he get to the truth? Easily Carrey\'s best role in my book, as he plays the good natured but slightly vacuous character whom we see evolve into someone much more capable than many - including his puppet-master - think possible. It\'s a comically savage indictment on the routine nature of the life so many people go through as one year follows another with little, if any, change to the safe daily regimen. The writing allows Carrey to deliver a plausibly characterful effort that\'s entertaining and engaging and hats also ought to come of to his on-screen wife (Linney) who presumably sacrifices quite a lot for her art and watches the man she cares for become a bit of a personality car crash.

Maybe the old sailors were right - and there is an end of the flat world, as we know it...?', ""Directed by Peter Weir and starring Jim Carrey in a career-defining role, the film tells the story of Truman Burbank, a man living unknowingly in a reality TV show. This premise alone sets it apart in cinematic history. Truman felt real, relatable, and honestly, just amazing.\r\n\r\nWhat makes this movie special is how unique the story is. Back in 1998, the idea of someone’s life being filmed without them knowing was way ahead of its time. The film captured and critiqued a cultural shift before it fully unfolded. Watching Truman figure out that his whole world is fake and trying to break free is equal parts heartbreaking and inspiring. It really makes you think about how much of your life is influenced by the world around you and what’s actually real.\r\n\r\nThe choice of location was genius, the town Truman lives in, Seahaven, is picture-perfect. It was filmed in Seaside, Florida, and honestly, it looks like something out of a postcard. But that’s the point, it feels like the kind of place you'd dream of but quickly realize is too good to be true, just like Truman’s life. The way they shot the movie is genius too. Cinematographer Peter Biziou masterfully used unconventional angles, hidden-camera perspectives, and subtle vignetting to make you feel like you’re watching Truman through the eyes of the people spying on him.\r\n\r\nThematically, The Truman Show hits hard. It’s about the constructed realities we live in, whether imposed by media, society, or even ourselves. It explores what it means to live authentically and the cost of breaking free from comfort and illusion. And honestly, how many movies make you question the nature of your own life?\r\n\r\nBeyond the story, the film’s legacy is remarkable. It anticipated a world of mass surveillance and reality TV, making it more than just a movie, it’s a cultural touchstone. Even now, its themes feel fresh and unsettling, like it was made for today.\r\n\r\nIt’s not just an entertaining watch but a thought-provoking experience that stays with you long after the credits roll. Whether it’s your first time watching or a revisit, The Truman Show feels like a mirror to our times.""]"

I mean, how couldn\'t it be?! Besides belonging to the superhero genre, DC has been on a streak of great films within its universe, so an isolated installment definitely excites me, especially about one of the evilest villains ever. It\'s by far one of the less comic-book-y flicks of the century. It doesn\'t follow the generic origin story formula, it avoids any cliches associated with the genre, and it\'s the type of movie that\'s becoming more and more rare nowadays. It\'s a character study like we haven\'t seen in a long time.\r\n\r\nI\'ll simply begin with the person that elevates the entire thing: Joaquin Phoenix. Now, if there\'s something I\'m not going to do is compare his performance with Heath Ledger\'s. That\'s the number one mistake people are going to keep making forever. First of all, The Dark Knight and Joker couldn\'t be more distinct films, even if they belong to the same genre (despite Joker being unique, it\'s still about a famous comic-book villain). Then, despite Phoenix and Ledger portraying the same ""version"" of the clown (crazy, sadistic psychopath), the former is 90% Arthur Fleck while the latter is 100% Joker, throughout each of their movies. Finally, Phoenix is the sole protagonist of this feature, while Ledger had the best live-action Batman sharing the spotlight.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it\'s both unfair, and a bit unreasonable to compare both interpretations since their roles have a different impact on the narrative, as well as each film being entirely different. In the end, both are impressive. However, let\'s switch to Phoenix since he\'s the star of this show … He has 2019\'s best performance, by far! With a strong marketing campaign, I\'m sure he\'ll get that Oscar. I hope so! It\'s so well-deserved. Todd Phillips and Scott Silver developed a brilliant screenplay, but Phoenix elevates it to a whole other level.\r\n\r\nThroughout the entire runtime, I felt weird. Perturbed. Even uncomfortable with what I was watching and consequently feeling. It\'s a dark, brutal, violent, emotionally powerful origin of a villain who I feel disturbingly empathetic towards. Phoenix makes the story work due to its remarkably captivating display of someone who\'s mentally ill. Arthur Fleck slowly becoming crazier is due to how society behaves and not due to some chemical pool that transforms his skin white and hair green (nothing wrong with this, but I know which origin story I prefer). ""The world is getting crazier out there"", and it becomes excruciatingly painful to deal with it, especially when so much is going on with Arthur’s personal life, and most of it he doesn\'t even realize because he tries to hide everything behind a smile.\r\n\r\nIt\'s a screenplay filled with narrative twists that not only pack a punch of surprise but leave you feeling extremely upset. The last act is one of the best in the last few years. If the second act is an enormous build-up, the last one is a terrific payoff. I can\'t remember the last movie I saw where I loved 100% every single narrative decision. I wouldn\'t do any of the big moments differently. There are so many excellent references hidden in plain sight that comic-book fans (and fans of the TDK trilogy as well) will love just like I did. In the ending, there\'s one pivotal moment in particular that serves as the absolute climax … I got chills all over my body. They couldn\'t have done that scene more perfect. I only have one tiny nitpick with the way some scenes feel repetitive since they neither move the plot forward or give us anything new. Some of these still help to create tension, some feel like they\'re just… there.\r\n\r\nA Best Picture and Best Actor nominations seem to be on its way, but these are not the only achievements that deserve to be recognized. The original score by Hildur Guðnadóttir is incredibly addictive, so much that I\'m listening to it while writing this review. It definitely helps to generate tremendous build-up, and it elevates the sinister environment of Gotham City. Lawrence Sher\'s cinematography is utterly stunning. The underexposure of some scenes is glorious. Sher paints the screen with so many gorgeous shots, especially with his close-ups on Phoenix, where the latter is able to shine. Jeff Groth is also impeccable in the editing room. There are several long takes with Phoenix just giving his all and letting all his emotions out (or keeping them all contained), which is always something I deeply appreciate since it helps with the flow of the narrative.\r\n\r\nRegarding the film\'s controversy surrounding its messages and the incentive to violence, I really don\'t know what to say. It\'s ridiculous. I remember those times when going into the movie theater was a surreal experience. It was the number one place for people to forget about their lives, jobs, everything. Joker is a fictional story! It\'s the origin of one of the worst psychopaths in the history of comic-books and cinema. If people expected to leave the theater ""happy"" or ""joyful"", then at least one of the film\'s message is right: society really is getting crazier. Have people forgotten who Joker is? What could you possibly expect from his origin story?!\r\n\r\nNowadays, no one knows how to behave (social media is the primary source for spreading hate). No one respects the fellow citizen or even the world itself. More and more people only look at their own bellies. Political agendas are everywhere. New extreme movements are created every other year. Social hypersensibility is exponentially growing. The same way some people will hate this movie for not being able (or simply not wanting) to accept that they feel empathy towards a murderer, people all around the world behave like their actions don\'t reflect on another person\'s life and on their own planet. If people get ruthlessly violent because they watched Joker, how can someone complain that the film\'s message is bad when it\'s eventually true?\r\n\r\nAll in all, Joker is one of the best movies of the year, and it\'s definitely on my Top3 at the date of this review. Joaquin Phoenix delivers my favorite male performance of 2019, by elevating a script about the origin of one of the evilest villains ever. The way he gradually becomes more insane is worthy of study, but it\'s how he\'s able to make the audience create empathy towards a psychopath that leaves me disturbingly captivated. Todd Phillips produces a character-study filled with an astonishingly tense build-up and one of the most chill-inducing payoffs of the last few years. With every single narrative decision nailed perfectly, Hildur Guðnadóttir\'s score and Lawrence Sher\'s cinematography stand out. The lack of restraint in showing the unmerciful violence (physical and mental) that society inflicts on one another is what makes us feel unsettled. Because we know it\'s mostly true, and we refuse to accept it. It\'s not a film about the Joker. It\'s a very realistic portrayal of someone (anyone!) who can become someone like him. And it\'s disturbingly brilliant!\r\n\r\nPS: Robert DeNiro (Murray Franklin) and Zazie Beetz (Sophie Dumond) are also great. Phoenix\'s performance is so mesmerizing that I almost forgot there were other actors in the movie.\r\n\r\nRating: A', ""Joker. The character that has existed since 1940, has become so heavy with so many different portrayals, different origins, that it feels impossible for any mortal man alive to impersonate the scattered personalities. It is an insurmountable task for any director to digest it all and still produce one more.\r\n\r\nTodd Phillips had a crazy challenge. He brought in one of the best actors alive to lift it with him, Joaquin Phoenix. Together, they have built a mass-market masterpiece which is just above the crop. It is appropriately crazy and completely focussed on the central character. The narrator goes close to the shores of that craziness, wets his feet but remains dry to tell this story. It is like those news reporters which go closer to the burning amazon, but it is impossible to step in the fumes. In no way, Joker is telling his story. Instead, his story is told to us and there are pillars of sanity (like the detectives, asylum clerk etc.) which remain steadfast to give a strong anchor to the audience. This dilutes the effect of the film.\r\n\r\nWith the copious amount of material on Joker already, I wished to consider this film as a standalone character study vaguely inspired by the batman universe. But this is not entirely possible. I was forced to think about it on two levels. With Batman and Without Batman. \r\n\r\nWith Batman, The Joker is on the home turf. There have been many renditions of Joker, and Heath Ledger's portrayal is still vivid in my mind. I knew that Arthur here will go on to become someone who is going to say, “\u200eIntroduce a little anarchy. Upset the established order, and everything becomes chaos. I'm an agent of chaos...”. When I was thinking Joker in the context of Batman, I could not keep Ledger's joker too far away. I was searching for a path for Arthur to go from the mentally unstable to the calculating anarchist. I was left searching for that path when the movie ended. To remain as the crown prince of crime, and to justify the title of the greatest adversary of Batman, just mental instability isn't good enough. He needs to be much more intelligent, much more cunning. These traits are often visible early, In the case of Arthur, I could not find that complete foundation upon which the later psyche can stand. This reminded me of Cameron Monaghan's Jerome Valeska. The joker of my understanding is somewhere between the cruelty of Jerome and pitiable delusions of Arthur. Also, the iconic Batman moment was not needed in this. I kept feeling that Joker is trying to stand with the support of Batman's tale as a clutch. A safety net enforced by the producers.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if I consider this movie as a standalone tale, then it was a bit more satisfying. There are tearjerker movies where nothing good ever happens with the protagonist. A series of bad lucks, or difficulties keep blocking a normal life. He is most definitely poor, has a sub-optimal family background, has a medical affliction which is unique and provides a foundation of the pity I felt. This is not very far from Rani Mukharjee's Hichki if you only consider the medical condition. Rani's Naina had Tourette syndrome while Joaquin's Arthur suffers from pseudobulbar affect. The setting and genre make the two films vastly different. More often than not, I have noticed these disorders lift a lot of burden from the narrative. In the case of Joker, couple his disorder with usually being in the wrong place at the wrong time, you have a travesty of human life. Add to that, an unstable parent, amplify it with the volatile societal conditions, you have a perfect decoction of what Joker is made of. As a tale of its own, it works. The delivery is great thanks to the spectacular performance. It also helps to increase the awareness of mental health. But when you strip off all the Batman context, it remains a well-acted and averagely written tale. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this is a single film, and I felt it is torn between these two polarising treatments. It wants to find its ground, which it finds. But that ground is far from being sensational. It remains somewhat indecisive. It can not be well soaked in Batman lore like James Gordon's tale, Gotham is. I am considering Gotham because both Gotham and Joker do not feature Batman, but they both have Bruce. Gotham understands its lore and fully embraces it but Joker does not want to. At the same time, as a tale of the psychologically troubled protagonist, Joker tries to play safe with the aim to please audience en-mass. I kept thinking about American Psycho and The Machinist. (Coincidently, both star ex-Batman Christian Bale). Those two take you in the psyche of the protagonist. Those take you inside the burning Amazon and not stand at a safe distance. Joker does not aim to do so. \r\n\r\nI am not at all qualified to talk about the acting performances. Joaquin Phoenix is in every frame and the way he waltzes between emotions is terrifyingly amazing. The Tai Chi to calm himself down, the menacing stare when finally becomes the Joker, those are chilling. He lives the character to the best of his abilities. Regrettably, he does not have the same level of writing support which Heath Ledger had and so due to no fault of his own, Joaquin could not topple Heath Ledger's portrayal of the crown prince of crime.\r\n\r\nIf I consider Todd Philips's entire resume, this was a genre shift for him. He knew very well that the biggest trump card is Joaquin Phoenix, so he takes no risk. He keeps him in focus, almost always all the setting and cinematography works for him. The only exception being Robert De Niro. Robert is allowed to carry his scenes quite independently. I think Todd Philips relied on both these giants to carry their parts. Sadly, I had gone to a theatre which had a bad print or screen so I think I will have to watch it again sometimes to enjoy the cinematography.\r\n\r\nI realised, I kept writing a lot and this is already over a thousand words. If you are here and reading still, I must say thank you. To summarise, The Joker worked for me and I enjoyed it, but I would not consider it the best depication of the iconic villain from comic books. The best may yet come."", 'The Joker is similar to the DC Joker character but is not a criminal genius. The movie was a great depiction of how a person who has been mistreated, lied to, and ignored, totally lacking access to human compassion, can snap. The acting is top notch, and it puts a spotlight on the importance of mental health in modern times.', 'Okay, this film has already been so widely debated that I’m not sure what I can really add to the conversation. So, I’ll just give my thoughts.\r\n\r\n“Joker” is a fairly basic character study of Arthur Fleck, a mentally ill man who feels increasingly marginalized by an uncaring and brutal society in Gotham City. To start, the characters, except for Arthur himself, are pretty flat. They seem to have little purpose other than to further Arthur’s story. This includes Thomas Wayne, who in other media is portrayed as a man of many dimensions, wealthy but caring, and instilling these values in his son Bruce. Here, he is portrayed as much more uncaring and elitist. Which gives much less of an impact in the inevitable alley scene we see in everything remotely related to Batman. More on this in a minute. It’s important to the point.\r\n\r\nArthur suffers a condition that makes him burst into laughter at inappropriate times. He also has other unspecified mental illnesses. We’re never given the specifics. This is actually a little troubling because of the general depiction of mental illness. It almost seems like they are saying that if someone is mentally ill then they are a ticking time bomb and it’s only a matter of time before they go off. This is not a good look.\r\n\r\nAfter a series of events, Arthur begins spiraling downward, but at the same time realizes how much influence he can have over other people, an aspect of the Joker that isn’t often explored. And this is where the characters other than Arthur being rather flat comes into play.\r\n\r\nThere’s more than one indication that we are actually witnessing these events through Arthur’s eyes. And this creates a brilliant depiction of a narcissistic personality. The only character that gets fully fleshed out is Arthur himself, but he can’t or won’t connect with other people to see their depth. As such, we get to see narcissism from the inside, no connection to others and in fact seeing them as pawns in his own schemes. It’s subtle and definitely not in your face, but if you look carefully, the hints are there.\r\n\r\nThose who fear that ""Joker"" would glorify incel violence or otherwise can rest a little easier, but as I mentioned, the film isn\'t without its troubling portrayals. It does vilify the mentally ill, which creates a whole host of other issues. The movie swings wildly between ""excellent"" and just ""okay,"" and sometimes even ""meh."" As such, it gets a recommendation, but only a mild one.', '*A Masterpiece*.\r\n\r\nThe movie shows the escalating events that made Arthur become the Joker. Initially an inoffensive poor and sick man, Arthur suffered a tide of unfortunate events that pushed him closer and closer to the edge. \r\n\r\nIgnored and despised by everyone, sick and alone in the world, and neglected by the State, Arthur becomes progressively more violent until he breaks.\r\n\r\nMuch more than one more Super-hero movie, *Joker* uses well-known characters to promote the reflection on the ""ignored"" ones. At least, ignored until they become a Joker.', '***Not fun, but absorbing, artistic and tragic***\r\n\r\nA mentally troubled middle-aged clown (Joaquin Phoenix) who lives with his mother (Frances Conroy) in Gotham City goes from not good to worse when he finally realizes his true identity. Robert DeNiro plays a talk show host and Zazie Beetz the friendly girl down the hall. Brett Cullen is on hand as Thomas Wayne, Bruce’s rich father.   \r\n\r\n""Joker"" (2019) is an arty, slow-burn character study of the popular DC Comics’ villain, but it’s more of a psychological crime drama/thriller and tragedy than a superhero flick (or, in this case, supervillain). The movie’s captivating from the get-go and practically everything works for a broodingly superb cinematic experience. \r\n\r\nThere are several amusing bits, but this ain’t a fun flick. It’s heavy and tragic. But what’s the message? Simply that this is how a quirky man who wanted to make people laugh became The Joker. He’s a little reminiscent of the clown in Steve Gerber’s “Night of the Laughing Dead” in Man-Thing #5 (1974).     \r\n\r\nThe movie runs 2 hours, 2 minutes, and was shot in New York City (Bronx, Harlem, Manhattan) and nearby New Jersey (Jersey City & Newark).  \r\n\r\nGRADE: A-/A', ""_Joker_ is a tour-de-force of a movie, not quite like anything I've seen, maybe since Taxi Driver. At its core it's a movie about the breaking point of a broken man, wrapped under the banner of a comic book movie that, take out the Waynes, works on its own.\r\nJoaquin Phoenix truly gives a transformative performance (not unlike Heath Ledger) and will say is deserving of an Academy Award. The supporting cast all did well, though, and it is a small role, Zazie Beetz was great and De Niro had his moments, particularly at the end.\r\n\r\nGot to hand it to Todd Phillips, between this and the good, albeit flawed, War Dogs, has proven to be more than those Hangover movies.\r\n\r\nNo, this isn't a feel-good movie and while it does sit at the top of my 2019 list, not entirely sure when I'd revisit. **4.75/5**"", ""the ‘Hangover 2 & 3’, the two most uncomfortable comedies he’s ever directed that felt more crime drama than anything funny. There’s also some dark humor in ‘Joker’ that involves a door chain. It’s silly, yet absolutely terrifying with the given context. A complete departure from his other work and that’s why I think it’s one of his best. I honestly think he made something so unique and meaningful. Seriously, I do.\r\n\r\nThe score by Hildur Guðnadóttir helped set the tone tremendously. A melancholy tone with a chaotic twist. A representation of Arthur slowly drowning in his own misery and pain. A little fun fact: The score for the film were written based on the script even before the actual filming of the movie started, which I think is the best way to do it, if you ask me. Someone to imagine movie by songs and incorporate their interpretation through music.\r\n\r\nThe cinematography was gorgeous and there’s a handful of shots that has imprinted into my memory. Lawrence Sher does an excellent job off showing the decaying Gotham city and the sewer waste look of the city. Bright neon lights with striking colors that manage to make the most run down of places look pretty.\r\n\r\nI like how they actually gave Thomas Wayne a character rather than “guy gets shot in alleyway”. He’s portrayed as a ruthless man with blunt ways of saving Gotham City. However he loves his wife and son, so his unforgiving attitude was all for the shake of keeping his loved ones safe. He’s also a massive movie buff where he often goes to watch the classics on the big screen. So it’s an interesting take on the character viewed in somebody’s else perspective.\r\n\r\nThere’s a scene where Arthur goes to watch a comedy standup show to take notes on a comedians act. Every time a joke is told and everyone laughs, his face is frozen in place with an unsure grin while his eyes look around the room wondering why everyone’s laughing, but when the laughter dies down he jumps to live with a delayed laugh. It’s moments like that are simple, yet says a lot about him. Basically showing how disconnected he is with humor and everyone else.\r\n\r\nNow lets talk about the controversy that's been surrounding this movie:\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most ludicrous controversy in recent memory. The movie will not cause or inspire violence, but shows why violence happens. I mean, there probably has been incidents when somebody committed a horrendous crime because their were influenced by a movie or a game. However, it’s he/she that should be brought into question, not the creators. Maybe this movie could inspire people to think twice about how they treat others. Why not think about the positives? If “Joker” is going to be responsible for violence and mass shootings, then so is every other movie with any form of violence ever. If people really care about how violence is portrayed in movies, then Rob Zombies ‘3 From Hell’ should also receive the same attention. Just imagine ‘Natural Born Killers’ times 100, but I guess it’s not mainstream enough for any of that. And sure, there’s some brutal and raw approach to violence in ‘Joker’, but we all have seen worst. ‘Deadpool’ is more graphic than this. It's not the directors duty to teach morals to the viewer. People will never learn to stop pointing fingers at things to blame and actually do something about it! People often understandment how much power their got.\r\n\r\nAnywhere, sorry about that folks, just had to get that off my chest. Go and check it out.\r\n\r\nOverall rating: “Send in the clowns” ⇠ you’ve gotta sing that like Frank Sinatra."", 'It is intersting to analyze this movie in a context of global increase of violent social movements against the Establishment. Joker succeed in making me accept a violent reactions without really explicit political fundation.', 'This is going to be one of those posts where I go against the mainstream but my reaction when I watched this movie was: You got to be f… kidding me?\r\n\r\nThe only resemblance to the REAL joker in this movie is the name. As far as I am concerned this movie is an insult to the fans of Batman and the REAL Joker.\r\n\r\nThe “Joker” in this move is a unintelligent deranged nutcase. There is a sob story in the background about how he became that way which is totally uninteresting.\r\n\r\nThe REAL joker is a intelligent criminal mastermind. I was waiting for this nutcase to actually become that for the entire movie. Spoiler alert, it never happened! This guy starts as a useless sobbing nutcase and he ends the movie as the same useless sobbing nutcase.\r\n\r\nThe movie has NOTHING to do with the real Joker. It is a blatant attempt to garner support for a unrelated psychopathic thriller by using the Joker name. If it would have been advertised as such I probably would have, if not liked it, so at least appreciated it for it’s qualities. It is indeed a well done movie technically and the main character is indeed excellently performed.\r\n\r\nHowever, even if I try to distance myself from the deceitful Joker label, I find it overall boring, too long and really a movie about a psychopath probably made by someone with mental issues himself. But then that’s Hollywood today.\r\n\r\nThat the politically biased and elitist so called “critics” on sites like Rotten Tomatoes like it is not really surprising but I have to confess that I am somewhat surprised at the rave ratings by real viewers on some other sites.\r\n\r\nHonestly, I was expecting to be disappointing by this movie. Then I am always cautious about movies getting rave reviews, especially from the previously mentioned totally useless and crappy “review” site. I did not expect this level of disappointment though. Epic fail as far as I am concerned.', 'Joker made me laugh , cry , and made me feel scared .

This movie also adds the idea of the ""one bad day"" theme from the killing joke comic where in the comic joker says and i quote \'\' all it takes is one bad day to bring the sanest man to lunacy "" and it takes that idea and brings it to the forefront. In conclusion I think joker was beyond amazing, between the acting, music score and set pieces it was a wild (and scary) ride . Symbolism also sneaks into the movie with slight things you wouldn\'t notice upon first watching . This movie leaves you confused on what was real and what wasn\'t . In the end between you and your spouse , friend , or family member will have reasons on what was real and what wasn\'t  and that\'s what made the movie even better for me , how it left me talking days after and like dark knight and iron man before this i believe that joker will change the superhero movie genre forever... send in the clowns 10/10 would see again', ""Each to their own, as always, but for me: Incredible!\r\n\r\nI was fully aware of <em>'Joker'</em> ever since its release, impossible not to be given the extraordinary hype that surrounded it, but it still absolutely surpassed my expectations - a sensational film.

Travis is one who is at odds with society, fed up with pimps, prostitutes, drug dealers, and all the other scum of the earth, he slowly works himself in his sleep deprived and drugged state to become a one man army ready to kill anyone he believes to be part of the problem.\r\n\r\nHis interactions with other cabbies, Betsy (Shepherd) a Presidential Candidate campaign worker, Iris a teenage prostitute (Foster), and her Pimp “Sport” (Keitel) fuels his destructive mission to rid New York City of its problems.

De Niro was nominated for the Best Actor Academy Award for this role.\r\n\r\nThe presentation on blu-ray is a solid one, PQ is nice, skin tones not waxy, and the AQ allowing the score, and surrounding noise subtleties to really shine through, it's very well handled for a source filmed in the mid 70's"", 'Robert De Niro is outstanding in this dark and gritty depiction of former marine ""Travis Bickle"". He spends his time, alone, driving his cab at night then watching seedy movies during the day. This relentless cycle is broken when he takes a shine to ""Betsy"" (Cybill Shepherd), a campaign worker for a would be US Presidential candidate. There is a glimmer of hope for him, as she agrees to go out with him for a movie - but when he takes her to his usual haunt for a Swedish film that perhaps wasn\'t quite Ingmar Bergman, he ends up back at square one. Simultaneously, he takes a more protective interest in the young ""iris"" (Jodie Foster) - a teenage hooker who is being used abused by her pimp, and to that end he acquires some firearms with which he is perfectly proficient, and so finally starts to see a purpose for his hitherto rather rudderness existence. Director Martin Scorsese and veteran scorer Bernard Hermann have created a wonderfully convincing and evocative scenario emphasising the seediness of a night time New York in which De Niro is able to thrive as few other actors could. He exudes a sense of helplessness but also of decency; he has integrity almost in spite of the indifference of his city, his peers - and by the end, I was firmly in his corner. If you can see it up on a big screen, then do so - it lends a great deal to this wonderfully atmospheric and potent piece of cinema.', '**_Hellish urban decay and one man’s step-by-step fall into Big City madness_**\r\n\r\nIn the mid-70s, an ex-marine insomniac in New York works the graveyard shift as a cab driver (De Niro) while trying to develop a relationship with a beautiful campaign volunteer for a presidential candidate (Cybill Shepherd and Leonard Harris). He experiences White Knight Syndrome as he seeks to rescue a 12½ years-old prostitute (Jodie Foster). \r\n\r\nWritten by Paul Schrader and directed by Scorsese, ""Taxi Driver"" (1976) is an interesting character study of a misfit and his descent into radicalness after the day-to-day grind of living amidst the grungy, unsanitary places of an infernal Gotham, especially the grindhouse district. The protagonist is a ‘contradiction,’ loathing the decadence he observes but frequenting porn theaters in his spare time. Then there’s the irony of a potential assassin perceived as a vigilante hero.\r\n\r\nThe notable cast also includes a young Harvey Keitel as the girl’s pimp and Peter Boyle as Travis’ mentor-like fellow cabbie. Albert Brooks in on hand as a protective colleague of the campaign volunteer. Scorsese shows up in a bit part as an unhinged cab passenger.\r\n\r\nIt’s a good companion-piece to similar Schrader flicks, like “Hardcore,” “Cat People,” “Auto Focus” and “Dog Eat Dog.”\r\n\r\nThe film runs 1 hour, 54 minutes, and was shot in Manhattan and Brooklyn.\r\n\r\nGRADE: B+/A-']"

It’s a meaningfully chaotic picture about trying to distil meaning from chaos and it’s a creative success about creative failure. It chronicles the resonant moments in one man’s life and admits that it can’t quite clarify why they matter. Doing justice to its early working title of The Beautiful Confusion, 8½ is a daring high wire act and an outstanding technical achievement that channels its story of artistic crisis into something sweepingly, uniquely profound.\r\n\r\nWorking again under Fellini’s direction after his winning performance in La Dolce Vita, Marcello Mastroianni plays Guido, a creatively blocked director feeling constantly distracted from the development of his latest semi-autobiographical work. Between avoiding his mistress (Sandra Milo) and disappointing his wife (Anouk Aimée), Guido spends time reflecting on his past, searching for answers and escaping into fantasies. The narrative seamlessly weaves in and out of Guido’s dreams and memories, to the point that it becomes impossible to distinguish real from imagined. The actress named Claudia, tellingly played by the legendary Claudia Cardinale, seems especially intangible, generally appearing only fleetingly in Guido’s visions playing the woman in his film that Guido intends to be a symbol of purity, innocence and redemption. The story, in a sense, is a mess but a brilliantly orchestrated mess that skilfully highlights the mysteries and confusions of life and the human psyche. Characters suddenly enter the narrative then leave before you’ve even noticed they’re gone because the film is confined within the periphery of Guido’s life. What these supporting players actually do isn’t as important as the impressions that they make. They’re all just additions to the fabric of the filmmaker’s mind.\r\n\r\nThis perception of the world is completely in tune with the engrossingly complex lead’s own self-involved view, seeing everyone he crosses paths with as a supporting player in his existence, rather than a fully-rounded individual with a long, complicated life of their own. Guido lacks awareness of the emotional impact of his actions and underestimates his own transparency, not realising when people detect his deceptions and cowardly evasions. His wife, Luisa, in particular seems more observant of Guido’s fraudulent nature than even Guido.\r\n\r\nIt’s made abundantly clear from the film’s choice of protagonist and its title (8½ being Fellini’s count of the number of films he’d made so far) that this film was meant to be viewed at least in part as a very personal work from the director. But if the weary half-heartedness of Guido’s filmmaking is meant to reflect Fellini’s own exhaustion, it’s evident that the director had got his groove back by the time shooting began. Every shot seems perfectly placed and every cut is perfectly timed for the film to fold out with effortless cohesion, like one extended monologue. Fellini hardly wastes a square inch of a single frame, saturating (but not over-saturating) his backgrounds with rhythmic movement and entrancing production design. His thoughtfully precise camera creates inexhaustible space, extending rooms by their mirrors and constructing distinct layers to the crowded environments he observes. This may well be the best directed film of Fellini’s celebrated career.\r\n\r\n8½ remains one of those rare feats of cinema that have proved highly influential (acclaimed descendants from recent years include Charlie Kaufman’s Synecdoche, New York and Paolo Sorrentino’s The Great Beauty) and yet still wholly unique. Even Fellini himself never made another work that so gracefully blended irony with sincerity, surreality with relatability and ambiguity with insightfulness, but once was enough. This richly intricate film is built to be endlessly re-seen, enjoyed and puzzled over. The final paradox of 8½ is that it refutes itself. Apparently when a great director doesn’t know what kind of film he wants to make, he makes a masterpiece.\r\n\r\nWritten by David Pountain\r\n\r\nWatch \'8½\' at <strong><a href=""https://www.filmdoo.com/films/8-1-2-/"">FilmDoo.com</a><strong> now (UK & Ireland Only)', ""**Fellini, deconstructed, improvised and enshrined in a film that (not) pleases everyone.**\r\n\r\nI'm not a fan or deep connoisseur of Italian cinema, but I've heard of Federico Fellini, and I know that this film is considered one of this director's best films. I haven't seen any of his films yet: this was the first. And honestly, I don't quite understand this fascination: the film is chaotic! I think that, unless someone is an expert in cinema, the vast majority of people who saw the film did not understand it, but then said that it was very good just to avoid being criticized. I'm glad I don't give a damn what other people think of me...\r\n\r\nFellini was out of great ideas, and the production started working without even having an idea of what the director was going to do. Not even he knew! He was about to give up when the light came: to make a somewhat autobiographical film about a filmmaker in crisis, who had to make a film due to studio commitments, but didn't know what film he wanted to make. Let's face it: it was an excellent idea, even if it resulted in a film that is too complicated and disjointed. Over the course of more than two hours, we see scenes and situations in which the director reflected a lot about himself in the main character: the complicated issues with a restrictive and judgmental Catholic faith, strong moral conflicts, a rebellious childhood, the omnipresence of impactful female figures (the mother, the wife, the objects of desire)… everything is composed as a delirium of a filmmaker empty of ideas. For the time, this was quite innovative, but looking closely today, it doesn't make much sense and is more tiring than interesting.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the film is excellent. The soundtrack, by Nino Rota, is quite atmospheric; the cinematography, with the framing, the differences in shot and sharpness, is an authentic lesson taught by a master. The choice of filming locations and sets is careful. Marcello Mastroianni and Claudia Cardinale are the most notable actors in the film, but they both have better works and I don't feel that this film is worth seeing because of them. But what really tired me was the artificiality of the dubbed dialogues: Fellini liked to film with noise (he's like that college students who like to study in crowded cafeterias), and the actors often improvised their lines over a sketch that was given at this moment, so all the dialogues were dubbed and arranged in post-production. The result is surreally strange and fake, with the movement of the mouth not matching what we are hearing.\r\n\r\nYes, this is one of the great works of Italian cinema, that's for sure, and when we see these points analyzed we can understand it better. But it is not the type of film that the general public wants to see, and it ended up being left to an intellectualist and hermetic elite, who like to treat cinema as their thing, with an almost mystical sort of knowledge that cannot be passed on to any mortal. I don't care about that, or what anyone calls me: films like that are good for sleeping."", 'Acclaimed director ""Guido"" (Marcello Mastroianni) is looking for a peaceable life after his last successful movie, but at every turn he is being pursued by people who want to capitalise on the success. He just hasn\'t the inspiration though - and determined not to just churn out any old rubbish, retreats to a small town for some rest, recuperation and hopefully inspiration. He in also rather reaping what he sowed as his wife ""Luisa"" (Anouk Aimée) and her rival ""Claudia"" (Claudia Cardinale) are vying for his increasingly frayed attentions and that makes any chance of concentration almost impossible. What happens now? Actually that\'s not so important to the thrust of the plot. What\'s a little more engaging here is a sort of hybrid illustrating the foibles of those creatives desperate for and addicted to the whole process of making a film as well as all of them demonstrating just how difficult it can be to actually produce a feature film. The narrative is also quite confusing at times with chronologies blurring and timelines being adapted as if on a whim - and those whims aren\'t always immediately clear to us who watch on bemusedly. There\'s something natural about the characterisations too. The venal, the aspirational, the lovelorn, the lovestruck - and the director who is genuinely swimming through a series of doldrums from which he cannot readily escape. The intensity never really lets up - indeed every time you see Guido Alberti - his long-suffering producer ""Pace"" you almost want to weep for a ""Guido"" under the sort of relentless pressure usually reserved for the father of a family of two hundred dependents. Mastroianni juggles the balls required for this part skilfully and by the mid point of this 2¼ cinema curiosity I felt a degree of his physical and emotional exhaustion visited on me, too! Nino Rota could always be relied upon provide a solid score - and here he reflects the mood of the story and it\'s personalities with an eclectic series of themes that range from the adagio to an entertaining Italian version of a grand scale hokey cokey. There\'s maybe just a little too much dialogue for me here. It\'s all pretty break-neck paced anyway, and occasionally I did just want them all to shut up - but this is still a potpourri of ideas and personae that offers an amusing look at film making and film makers alike.']"

What\'s striking about this is the way the violence is portrayed. The kids are always removed from the room and then it\'s a dance.

Is it real, imaginary, alien, all of these - or it is all just a cerebral hallucination of a place that, like El Dorado, we imagine to be where all of our problems can go away, be solved, eradicated. It is loosely based on the Strugatsky brothers early seventies sci-fi novel ""Roadside Picnic"" but it\'s fair to say that Andrei Tarkovsky opens up the more linear aspects of their story leaving us with a much less defined and more intangible series of threads as these men undergo significant travails to get to a place - that frequently resembles what I imagine Chernobyl to have look like after it exploded. As with so many aspects of human aspiration, the narrative is all about what I would call the chase - the journey or the means - without the characters ever really knowing what it is they will truly want if they do actually achieve their goal. Again, the director provides us with lots of bits of this mischievous, sometimes perilous and thought-provoking Rubik\'s cube - but it is incomplete. We know it is always going to be. We, the audience, have to bring a bit of ourselves to this particular party. There is a denouement - three men in a room. One (Nikolai Grinko) with a hefty nuclear bomb that he believes may offer a solution; another (Anatoly Solonitsyn) who\'s darkest id well outmanoeuvres his ostensibly well meaning reasons for being there and of course the stalker himself (Alexander Kaidanovsky). This production is deliberately, and effectively slowly paced. The dialogue can be intense, their frustrations and dreams well encapsulated; but it can also be sparing - there are plenty of periods of protracted silences from them all. Accompanied by an eerily complimentary score from Eduard Artemyev, we are left with an experience rather than just a film. I saw it on a big screen, and if you can I\'d recommend that. It helps you to stay focused on the complex and quirky plot whilst bringing out the finely crafted bleakness, and hope, of the photography.', ""**More style than content.**\r\n\r\nThis was my first contact with the cinematographic work of Andrei Tarkovsky, a Soviet filmmaker who would end his career outside his native country when he fell into disgrace for allegedly spending too much money on films that were not worthy of the expense. A regrettable attitude, but typical of countries that prefer to spend money on missiles than on support for culture and education, especially after considering how dangerous and insubmissive can be a cultured population capable of thinking without anyone from a party saying what It's the right thing.\r\n\r\nThis is not, however, an ordinary Soviet film, loaded with subliminal messages, more or less direct, demonizing the rich and praising the effort and dignity of workers. On the contrary. Tarkovsky takes us to a desolate world, apparently hostage to repressive authority. There is nothing beautiful there. And there is a space where no one can go, called the Zone, in which there is, supposedly, a room that makes the dreams of those who arrive there come true. However, the difficulty is immense.\r\n\r\nBeing a Russian film, it is obviously a huge, dull, heavy film. Let's face it, it's to be expected: Russians like big things. Big countries, big armies, gigantic cannons and missiles. Russia cultivates that taste for gigantism, of which the Tsar-Pushka is a prominent symbol. It's difficult to see everything, the way the film develops, in deliberate slowness, is exhausting and dark. The cinematography is partly in sepia (color comes later, and the colors are directly associated with entering the prohibited area) and has been well crafted, as have the sets and filming locations. The rest simply doesn't matter: it's a film that is almost silent, and that puts style above substance.""]"

Things take a bit of a downturn when, suddenly, ""Kralik"" falls a little foul of his normally jovial, somewhat dithery, boss - and though the audience can readily guess why, it takes a while for the old gent to realise the error of his ways. There is something immeasurably genial about the whole thing. The scenes in the stockroom where they are moving what are clearly empty boxes, the character actors in support - especially Joseph Schildkraut (""Vadaz"") and the ever reliable Felix Bressart (""Pirovitch"") frequently raise a smile but it\'s always Morgan who steals the scenes as the amiable employer who gets the wrong end of the stick. Certainly a classic film from Ernst Lubitsch, well worth searching out on a big screen if you can.']"

A crucial disclaimer: you\'ll see countless reviews based on wholly different approaches. Some people will review it as a standalone, regular movie, while others will look at it as an extended/alternate cut of a film previously released. I\'m part of the latter group of reviewers.\r\n\r\nI find it a bit unfair to criticize pacing issues or an overlong runtime when the purpose of this cut is precisely to show everything Snyder had in his hand. Director/Extended/Ultimate Cut, call it what you feel it\'s appropriate, but it\'s a four-hour movie, so many scenes will inevitably drag or feel unnecessary and irrelevant. The narrative is fundamentally the same, which means the audience knows what\'s coming from a general perspective. Still, I\'m reviewing this version mostly on its own merits, but without forgetting that it\'s not a regular theatrical film and that it unquestionably builds upon what was already released.\r\n\r\nWithout getting into spoilers, I do have to write this: the heavy marketing was incredibly misleading, and I don\'t doubt for a second that many fans will feel disappointed regarding certain story points and particular characters. The whole ""it\'s a totally distinct movie"" or ""Joss Whedon only used 10% of Snyder\'s footage"" were nothing more than false publicity for a cut that honestly didn\'t need it. Out of the 119 minutes of the 2017\'s version, probably around 80/90 minutes are also in the Snyder Cut, which will be surprising for people who expected something entirely unique. The base of the narrative is identical, most scenes are just extended versions of the original, but there are a couple of significant new changes that ultimately make Zack Snyder\'s Justice League better than its ""predecessor"".\r\n\r\nThe most impactful modification that drastically changes the emotional core of the film is about Cyborg. Ray Fisher\'s character goes from barely having any remotely significant screentime in 2017 to being the heart and soul of the movie. From his backstory to the development across the runtime, Cyborg is undoubtedly the superhero that gains the most with this cut, leaving as a complete, compelling character who I genuinely cared for. On the other hand, Aquaman and The Flash receive similar introductory scenes with Batman, barely getting any sort of new individual growth besides more action sequences. However, once the League is assembled, the character interactions increase, improving their team spirit and deeply elevating the ""Us United"" storyline.\r\n\r\nThe humor and tone remain lighter than in other Snyder films, clearly something that the filmmaker always had in mind for his version (Whedon only added a couple of more jokes since most of them are present in this cut). The intimidating runtime does negatively affect the overall pacing, but the longer build-ups and extensive dialogue scenes make the full movie much more cohesive and coherent. Compared to the original\'s abrupt, awful editing work, the Snyder Cut has a tremendously better flow, giving time for information to sink in and characters to get used to each other. I rather watch an overlong film with a well-built story than the complete contrary. Some color changes and tone adjustments also improve the movie\'s consistency.\r\n\r\nStory-wise, besides the fantastic arc given to Cyborg, there are a couple of changes that heavily affect either a particular character or a secondary storyline, but when it comes to the main narrative, it\'s more or less about the same. Every action sequence with pre-existent footage is visually improved and extended with scenes not seen before, but the new VFX are as hit-and-miss as Junkie XL\'s score. The latter mixes up so many different types of tracks and music that it genuinely becomes a tad confusing. While some scenes get an absolutely perfect, epic soundtrack, others receive weird, out-of-place music distracting the scene itself.\r\n\r\nThere\'s only one change I definitely dislike: the R rating brings horribly artificial, forced blood splashes and out-of-nowhere cursing that simply don\'t belong in the film. I know Snyder loves his gritty, bloody, gory action - as do I - but either the whole movie is consistent with this type of action, or some scenes will feel like they come from a wholly separate film. A few bloody sequences work well enough, but most just feel notably forced, while the cursing feels ridiculously out-of-character at points. It\'s by far the most incompatible aspect of the cut, but admittedly, one that doesn\'t heavily impact my opinion.\r\n\r\nA common issue I have with extended cuts is that these mostly add and rarely remove. Snyder Cut partially breaks that rule, removing some scenes from the 2017\'s version, supposedly only Whedon\'s footage (which some people wrongly believe to be almost the entire movie). While most of the decisions regarding this process are efficient, there\'s a couple of them that not only don\'t improve the respective storylines but actually make them less powerful than the theatrical film. For example, in Snyder Cut, the ""bringing Superman back"" arc lacks an important character\'s take on the situation, having in mind that character\'s past. It actually feels a bit out-of-character that the viewers don\'t get to see what that person thinks about a potentially devastating action.\r\n\r\nRegarding Steppenwolf, his design looks better than the terrible original, and his motivations are clearer, but unfortunately, he remains a generic CGI punching bag for our superheroes. His dynamic armor is packed with spikes, but it\'s really one of those designs with visual impact only since it has no effect whatsoever in battle. I can\'t get into spoilers about Darkseid or DeSaad, but I can safely write that these characters are nothing more than fan-service, just like Joker (Jared Leto). The ending is definitely the sequence that changes the most due to the addition of dozens of new/extended action scenes, and it does play out differently - though the conclusion is essentially the same - leaving the viewers with a menacing threat on the horizon.\r\n\r\nZack Snyder\'s Justice League is arguably a more cohesive, consistent, and emotionally compelling movie than the 2017\'s version. As expected, its four-hour runtime causes pacing issues and possesses dozens of unnecessary, irrelevant scenes, but criticizing these aspects in an admittedly non-theatrical cut is unfairly defeating its purpose. Despite most of the original Justice League being present in the Snyder Cut - something that might surprise a few fans - the main narrative is built and developed through a structure that flows tremendously better than the previous edition. Cyborg becoming the emotional core of the story and the increased character interactions are some of the best changes Zack Snyder and Chris Terrio did. The extended action sequences are more riveting, and pre-existent footage is definitely improved, but the new VFX are as erratic as Junkie XL\'s all-over-the-place score. The R-rating is the only straight-up negative aspect that damages the film with highly forced, fake-looking blood and rare yet cringe-worthy cursing. Highly anticipated characters and/or storylines are better described as unimpactful fan-service, but overall, most of the decisions made vastly improve upon what was already built. In the end, I sincerely expect a significant majority of the fandom to get their expectations fulfilled, and I hope that the DCEU continues with Snyder involved - just as long as the studios leave filmmakers to do their job without nonsensical restrictions.\r\n\r\nRating: B', ""Definitely an improvement over the Whedon version and as a DC fan, enjoyed plenty of the character moments (and the addition of MM) but the story did feel off even though the film is nearly four hours long, in addition the alternate timeline part at the end felt tacked on and unnecessary. The visual effects looked like something from a video game but I can forgive that since I'd imagine it'd cost an additional $100M to make it look cleaner and more realistic.\r\n\r\nGiven what Snyder had to work with and the fact in reality the studio should've been patient and given him and his family to mourn and re-group later, I am glad this did become a reality, shame that outside of maybe The Flash movie there won't be a follow-up with Darkseid. **3.5/5**"", ""This is DC's best so far...easily.  \r\nAlthough not flawless- there are a couple of scenes that didnt need to be included - this is the version that we needed to see.  \r\nThere is so much more time given to the characters in this, the plot is better thought out and structured, and Steppenwolf is no longer a joke.  There is actually an urgency in his battles with the JL now.  And OMG, Darkseid and Desaad look and sound boss.  \r\nThe recruitment is harder, the fight between the JL and Supes and then the JL and Steppenwolf is more brutal, and Superman's 'recovery' is better paced and makes more sense. \r\nThis also follows directly on from BVS and links directly into Aquaman. \r\nAnd the closing cover of Hallelujah is glorious (it near comes close to Jeff Buckley's angelic version)\r\n\r\nIt's flaws - Timing of release - I need to watch this in a cinema.  FU WB for not giving Snyder the time to finish this as he envisioned.  THIS is what we should have gotten, not the tripe that was Josstice League.  This movie shows that Snyder was not just trying to catch up to Marvel, he was their own version of their stories and it should have been allowed to come to the end of the cycle.  \r\nAlso, I was underwhelmed by the score and would have loved Zimmer to have returned to complete this.  \r\nAnd there are a couple of initial set-up scenes that could have been let go or shortened and the gapping continuity error scene in the middle where the JL get introduced to Alfred after theyve already met him should have just been left out. \r\n\r\nBut we got what we asked for - the Snyder Cut in its entirety. \r\nAnd I am grateful for that...thankyou.\r\n\r\nNow, could we please create ZSJL2 so we can see the Injustice and Darkseid stories."", ""I really, really REALLY wasn't expecting this - it felt like the extended edition of Lord of the Rings, if Zack Snyder directed it!\r\nNo, this was Zack Snyder's vision of Justice which we should've seen, if it wasn't for Joss Whedon hadn't pissed all over it. I mean, I understand why Snyder had to pull out the production, I really do, but Whedon could've had the decency to keep to heart on Snyder's work. Looking back, it was a total disrespect to the visionary director. This film...wow! It was truly and 100% amazed me.\r\n\r\nPlus, my best highlight was the voiceover of of Superman's dads Johnathan and Jor-El reminding him of who is he - it felt poignant.\r\n\r\nThat said, a couple of things I feel I must complain about this, just small things; 1) I noticed Mera had a change of accent. Probably an original idea, but it sounded funny especially soon after 2018 Aquaman was released. 2) Victor Stone's dad Silas sacrificed himself - not only was it upsetting but it changes everything for the future of DCEU films. I guess this means they;ll have to rewrite everything for that Cyborg movie!\r\n\r\nAt least we got the introduction of the Joker (Jared Leto reprising his role) as well as the (not so) surprising twist of the Martian Manhunter!\r\nNot to mention we finally got to see the appearance of Darkseid - it was all like a fusion of 300's Persian empire and LOTR's Sauron!\r\n\r\nIn the end, this was a true masterpiece from Zack Snyder, since Watchmen and Sucker Punch, and I am so pleased - no, grateful this was made. I thank not just the director himself for returning to this project but also the many fans who petitioned this director's cut to happen.\r\nFor once, we finally had something good out of all this chaos that was covid 19, hence why they chose the song Hallelujah for their Snyder cut trailer!\r\n\r\nThank you so much, Zack Snyder - you have always been my fav movie director.\r\nJoss Whedon, you are officially dead to me!"", '10/10 this is absolutely fantastic, just 1 word, #RestoreTheSnyderVerse', 'I don\'t understand why people are getting so horned up over this movie. It\'s got the exact same plot as the theatrical cut, but it\'s longer and more drawn out with unnecessary slow-motion and scenes that any editor worth their salt would have cut out (like Aquaman\'s Icelandic singers). And what we\'re left with?\r\n\r\nDarkseid gets his ass kicked and then forgets he was ever on Earth. Hardly anything spectacular.\r\n\r\nSteppenwolf\'s armor now looks like something designed by early 90s Rob Liefeld, which is not at all a compliment.\r\n\r\nThe Cyborg stuff was pretty good for the most part, although the sequence with the single mother was just as pointless as Whedon\'s Russian family and there was absolutely no logical reason why his father had to sacrifice himself. But Snyder is a fan of fathers sacrificing themselves when there is absolutely no logical reason for it (see Jonathan Kent in Man of Steel).\r\n\r\nSo what else is there?\r\n\r\n""Superman wears the black suit!""\r\n\r\nOkay...and...? It\'s just a black version of his usual suit, there\'s no story reason why he wears it, and it looks like Snyder intended for him to keep on wearing it. Which is stupid and doesn\'t fit that character at all. And amusingly enough, I see some of the people freaking out about this who in the 90s would have lost their shit if Tim Burton\'s black-suited Superman movie ever got made.\r\n\r\nWe also have Wonder Woman splattering bad guy brains over walls and vaporizing people RIGHT IN FRONT OF LITTLE KIDS! And once Steppenwolf is clearly defeated, Superman heat visions off part of his head FOR ABSOLUTELY NO REASON OTHER THAN CRUELTY! \r\n\r\nThis is what people are all pumped up for? To see Superman and Wonder Woman go all Abu Ghraib on people?\r\n\r\nOh, and we get the Martian Manhunter. Who clearly knows everything that\'s happening, BUT DOESN\'T LIFT A GODDAMN FINGER TO HELP OUT! Martian Manhunter, it should be added, IS ABOUT AS POWERFUL AS SUPERMAN! But does he turn up at the Batcave to say, ""You could probably use my help""? No, he just hangs back, impersonates Martha Kent, and then only shows up to offer his help AFTER THE THREAT HAS BEEN DEFEATED! Gee, J\'onn, maybe we could have used you back when Steppenwolf WAS FLAT-OUT MURDERING PEOPLE! This movie takes one of the greatest Justice Leaguers of all, a character who has always been a model of selflessness, and turns him into a coward who sits on the sidelines.\r\n\r\nAnd then of course we get the Knightmare sequence, where we get to be subjected once more to Jared Leto\'s absolutely godawful Joker performance, Batman drops an F-bomb because idiot fanboys with the emotional maturity of a 12-year-old think that\'s ""badass,"" and Snyder basically riles up his little cult so they can start harassing people about #RestoreTheSnyderverse.\r\n\r\nThis whole endeavor was nothing other than a reward for the absolute worst and most toxic elements of fandom. And now that they\'ve gotten this victory? They\'re going to be ten times as awful. Because now they\'ve had their tactics validated.', 'Admittedly, I don’t know as much about DC as I do about Marvel. However, I’m fairly well versed in them and the Justice League is my favorite DC team. When it was announced that DC would come out with a Justice League movie after the Avengers, I had hope...that is until I learned that they’d be doing a team movie first and individual movies afterward. This is the exact opposite of what Marvel did.\r\n\r\nDuring the production of the first movie, Zack Snyder had the incredibly unfortunate disposition of learning that his daughter had committed suicide. Understandably, he took a break from the movie. Because Warner executives don’t understand anything, they went on with the production.\r\n\r\nHiring Joss Whedon to finish the production, the final product was lackluster at best. In typical Zack Snyder style, it was more flash than substance. After it came out, Zack went public and said that the movie was nowhere near his final vision. Not long after this, the hashtag #releasethesnydercut was trending on Twitter. Four years later, the director’s cut was completed and we got a monstrosity of a movie. Now the true question is “Was this movie worth the hype?”\r\n\r\nHonestly...not really.\r\n\r\nNow I write this from the point of view of one who’s been a comic book fan for 32 years. Also realize that there are MANY stories that I haven’t read and equally as many storylines that I’m ignorant to. However, I understand the characters. I’m a firm believer that character develops story. George Lucas said: “A Special effect without a story is a pretty boring thing.” This is a lesson that Zack Snyder has never learned. Now, Joss Whedon gave us an amazing movie with The Avengers - and that’s the only comparison that I’ll make - so it’s possible that WB wanted some of that lightning in a bottle for JL and that’s why they brought him on.\r\n\r\nWhen Ray Fisher went public and said that Joss created a hostile work environment (as well as one of the producers), the way it was presented was that he didn’t get things that he wanted, so he’d complain. I’m glad to admit that I was wrong in that assumption. Ray actually opened the floodgates against Joss and it turns out that he’s not a good person - he’s a great writer and filmmaker, but that doesn’t make up for his behavior. This is relevant (and the last time I’ll mention it) because a good portion of this movie has Cyborg in it. The majority of his scenes were heavily cut from the first movie. Like 90% majority.\r\n\r\nI appreciate Zack wanting his vision to get out - every director has the right to tell a story the way they want to - but I wish that he’d step away from the writing process. He’s a great filmmaker but not a great storyteller. He needs a writer that has synergy with him.\r\n\r\nThat being said, the special effects are very well done, although I REALLY wish the comics would have been honored better. Simple things like the way the Boom Tubes were portrayed would have been great fan service. Also, the boxes are FATHER Boxes. A Mother Box is a little bit larger than a cellphone. Father Boxes are used for evil on Apokolips and the Mother Box is used for good on New Genesis. If a feministic agenda caused that change, then I disagree with the studio’s decision and a quick 15-second explanation (like what I just did) would have solved that problem and added more to the plot (all the while giving a nod to the New Gods). Yes, I’m critical but it’s important.\r\n\r\nMy favorite of the cast is Gal Gadot. She captures the essence of Wonder Woman perfectly. I also like Ben Affleck as Batman - I’ve always supported him in the role and he does a really good job with it. In fact, he’s second only to MIchael Keaton.\r\nNow this is where I’m probably going to get a lot of hate, so if if happens...bring it on…\r\n\r\nEVERYONE else in the cast I hate. EVERYONE.\r\n\r\nEzra Miller is easily the worst Barry Allen ever. He’s supposed to be Barry, but he acts like an immature Wally. Absolutely terrible.\r\n\r\nI HATE Henry Cavill as Superman. He’s bottom of the list for me. I think Man Of Steel sealed that opinion for me, but he’s just terrible. His suit in this was sharp, so I’ll give credit where it’s due.\r\n\r\nRay Fisher actually didn’t do a terrible job as Cyborg, but I’d never put Cyborg in the Justice League. If they wanted a robot-type character, they could have easily used Red Tornado.\r\nJason Momoa is just awful. He’s not Aquaman. I don’t care that he doesn’t have blond hair. He doesn’t fit the role. It would have been much better if he was cast as Lobo. He’s a much better fit there.\r\n\r\nWe also get a brief cameo by another Justice Leaguer that was a wasted opportunity but sets up a sequel that will probably never happen.\r\n\r\nI understand that Zack likes big spectacular shots in his movies. I understand that he wants these heroes to be larger than life. However, his style is very arthouse - there’s absolutely nothing wrong with that. There’s quite a few superheroes that would benefit from that style of filmmaking. These aren’t those superheroes. Zack needs to understand that many times less is more.\r\n\r\nUltimately, this movie is an anomaly. It’s an improvement on the first movie, but it’s not better. It tried to do so much, but had the individual hero movies come out first, there would have been so much more to the story. Instead, everything is crammed into this four hour long beast that doesn’t accomplish as much as it wanted.\r\n\r\nBecause of the improvements, and only because of the improvements I can only give this a 3 out of 5.', ""Say what you want about this movie! It's great and everything. But what do you say about this app? I think you guy should hire this one. He's a keeper."", ""Ok lets clear stuff up before hand. It's still the same movie with extra scenes. There alot of friction from which was good and bad or bad to worse. at the end its all about personal taste. Zack Snyder version was better covering the story of each character we have not seen in the series, but he also did stretch it out for so long that the movie hinges on to long. But overall a good movie just longer."", ""_Zack Snyder's Justice League_ is able to turn one of the worst superhero movies of all time into a fantastic film filled with great action, heart, and depth.\r\n\r\nThe original 2017 _Justice League_ cut was unbearable to watch, each line of dialogue felt out of place and extremely corny. I was physically cringing at almost every scene. These problems are completely wiped away in the Snyder Cut allowing for a more character focused and emotional telling of the dawn of the Justice League. The entire film is completely different, with scenes completely cut and the order adjusted to have a more organic viewing experience.\r\n\r\nWith a runtime of four hours, I was really nervous of feeling bored or the movie having a large amount of filler to pad the runtime, but that is not the case. Each scene is crafted perfectly to deliver important character depth, allowing the viewer to gain an emotional connection with each of our heroes. Cyborg, Flash, and Aquaman all have very fleshed out introductions, giving the audience a glimpse of their motivations and struggles living in a world with their powers. Cyborg has a tremendous arc with his struggling relationship with his father, which gets great pay off in the end of the film. The Flash feels grounded too with his motivation for fighting crime to help prove his father's innocence. With this new perspective and tone, his quips feel more like that of an immature kid (much like Spider-Man) rather than infused comedy that was forced by the corporate overlords.\r\n\r\nBatman and Wonder Woman are great in this film, with each giving arguably their best performance as their respective characters. Batman feels like a man who has truly learned from his past mistakes and wants to gather and lead his team rather than divide. Wonder Woman is a confident bad-ass Amazon who's heartfelt and understanding presence is the glue that holds the team together. Aquaman does not have all that much of an arc in this film but has a great lead into his solo movie which is noteworthy.\r\n\r\nNot only are the hero's more fleshed out but so are the villains. Steppenwolf has an actual motivation that the audience can sympathize with and understand. This leads him to feel more genuine in his conquest to take over the world. Steppenwolf plays really well with the backdrop of Darkseid who is looming in the background of every scene of our villain. It really creates a relationship akin to the Emperor and Darth Vader. The introduction of the life equation adds much more stakes and an emphasis on what the conquest is actually about.\r\n\r\nThe action in this movie is great. The R rating added more room for the scenes to be more brutal and visceral with blood and gore, and even a beheading! While the majority of the film had pretty decent CGI, there were a few scenes that looked really out of place. Especially the ones with Darkseid and his lackies, which reminded me of a character straight out of a PS2 game. This largely had to do with the limited budget and time constraints the Synder Cut was given.\r\nThis film delivers on Zach Snyder's vision of Justice League, and I am so happy it exists. Although it also brings a sense of sadness as well, because the movie sets up for so much potential for the DCEU and now that future has all but vanished.\r\n\r\n**Score:** _88%_\r\n\r\n**Verdict:** _Excellent_"", ""Yes it IS better than the previous version. There are parts I was a little bored with. There are some characters that were OVER embellished and OVER acted. It was good seeing Wonder Woman move fast ... However Zack musta not known that she CAN fly now thanks to WW84. I was annoyed half the time by Ezra's portrayal of Barry Allen ... But impressed with Cyborg being so much more in depth. For all the hype of DarkSeid ... He fell flat for me... And Steppenwolf was hard to look at sometimes... Being too much CGI. I love seeing the battles with Amazons, Atlantians, and Men vs DarkSeid. I hated Amber Heard period. All that teasing of the Joker for a small 5 minute nightmare scene with Batman being a total jerk was a little let down but Jared Leto played it so perfectly it made me want MORE. Martian Manhunter... I was so happy to see him. So much potential for so much more that could have been done but WB is being Aholes and not letting Zack continue. I love the movie... It was worth it and I am sad we won't get to see more. Thank for killing Justice League WB!"", ""**So long but so incredible! DC Comics fans rejoice! As an average movie-goer, it might be a bit too long for you.**\r\n\r\nWow! What could have been? This movie provided a master class on stunning visuals, character development, and world-building. It's shocking the disparity between the theatrical release and this movie. Surprisingly even after the 4 hour run time, I was left wanting more. The cast was superb at making these impervious characters with godlike power experience pain, loss, and emotion. The existence of this film is cinematic history in and of itself is a miracle. A director's cut with zero studio interference and such a drastic difference from the studio's original release ever seeing the light of day is astounding. And I am so glad it did. Zack Snyder's Justice League was a superhero epic that created a theatrical masterpiece worthy of DC's greatest heroes."", ""Some HBO Max subscribers were accidentally able to access, 10 days before its premiere, an hour of Zack Snyder's Justice League (2021) before the movie was cut off. This is not a bad strategy. An hour at a time of this gargantuan abomination is more than any thinking person can bear. ZSJL reminds me of Ambrose Bierce's famous book review; “The covers of this book are too far apart.” It doesn't help either that half the movie seems to occur in slow motion.\r\n\r\nSuperman's quote-unquote death has resulted in the reactivation of the “Mother Boxes” and the appearance of Darkseid's servant Steppenwolf on Earth. Steppenwolf hails from Apokolips, a planet that exists on a different plane of existence from the regular DC Universe, in spite of which he speaks perfect English, and his name is a German word for an animal presumably found only on Earth.\r\n\r\nSteppenwolf retrieves a Mother Box from Themyscira, following a battle of incredible proportions – not because it involves mythological beings and alien deities, but because the world of the Amazons is almost entirely computer generated, its scenery only slightly more sophisticated than an Age of Empires screenshot.\r\n\r\nHow can this movie ask us to believe in a place like Themyscira, when the film itself doesn't seem to have much faith in its existence? This is symptomatic of ZSJL, much of which takes place in a setting completely divorced from the real world – and my complaint is not that it's unrealistic, because ZSJL is fantasy after all; my problem is that it's not real. I mean, it's just not there.\r\n\r\nOther than as childhood wish fulfillment, true-blue superheroes are very hard – sometimes even impossible, as with the immortal, omnipotent Superman – to identify with or care about; their physical and moral perfection renders them boring and predictable. ZSJL makes it even harder by placing them in front of green/blue screens most of the time, constantly surrounded by wall-to-wall CGI, and unconvincingly engaging enemies who are literally an afterthought – digitally added in post-production, and very poorly at that.\r\n\r\nAnd speaking of characters that are nothing short of caricatures, there’s Flash (Ezra Miller). Barry Allen is annoying, irritating, obnoxious, insufferable, grating. He's like a very fast Jar Jar Binks. He's like the bastard son of Andy Dick and French Stewart. If he's so quick, why does it take him so long to get off my screen?\r\n\r\nAll things considered, there's nothing here we haven't seen in Avengers. Darkseid is Thanos, the Mother Boxes are the Infinity Stones, Batman is Ironman, etc., etc. The one difference is that Zack Snyder's Justice League is, though I would not have thought it possible, longer and more boring than any Marvel movie. The only thing that alleviates the overwhelming oppressiveness are the brief interventions of Willem Dafoe and Jeremy Irons, whose considerable talents are wasted on this debacle."", ""Well, the Flash had a back story and one that made him turn out to be not the sniveling coward that he was in the first cut.\r\n\r\nAnd it didn't end with that horrible over-dramatic race between Superman and Batman to save more people.\r\n\r\nAnd it had more of a plot.\r\n\r\nSo, in the end it's jut a much better movie than the steaming pile that was released...\r\n\r\n... but you're not supposed to like it because Twitter, Hollywood, the left in general and the media that supports it have all come to the conclusion that fans are evil for being fan.  And making a movie that the fans want makes you evil.  And the goal is to make movies the fans don't want to see, lose money on it, get praise by critics and lots of Twitter Twits, and then blame the fans for not watching a movie that you didn't make for the fans and made widely announced that you didn't make it.\r\n\r\nBut the fans demanded this, they wanted to see it, the demand caused the studio to release it, and when they did the fans came out to watch it and liked it.\r\n\r\nSo, despite it being far better than the original (and far too long) you are supposed to hate it because of politics... even though there are no politics in the plot.\r\n\r\nAnd then there is the fact that it the first release only sucked because of heavy studio interference, and so you can't celebrate as a studio being smart enough to go back and make it better for the franchise, you have to condemn it because the studio can't overcome, because that would be admitting a mistake.\r\n\r\nYou have to hate it, even thought it was pretty good and fantastic compared to the first attempt.\r\n\r\nSo. I don't know, I just think the salvaging that train wreck and proving it can be something watchable is pretty impressive."", ""Very long, and very tedious. How can a four-hour movie offer such little development? The heroes are basic and uninteresting and the villains are cringe-worthy. This movie should have been dark and edgy, instead, it was just child's fluff. And don't get me started on the 4:3 screen format. WTF!""]"

It\'s at breakfast that his pregnant daughter-in-law ""Marianne"" (Ingrid Thulin) decides to invite herself along.

It\'s only when he arrives for his ceremony that he begins to reassess his life, his perspectives and his priorities. Sjöström is super here. He really carries off the role in almost ""Scrooge""-like fashion. He has taken the emotionally easy way out for much of his life and now finds himself in an unfulfilling cul-de-sac from which it not might be possible to escape. Thulin also delivers well as the deliberately provocative and seemingly unkind woman who spares him none of the knife. There is plenty of humour - dark and mischievous, and we take quite an interesting look at just how toxic introspection can be - at any age. As ever with this director, questions of religiosity and God are never far away, but here they are delivered in a manner than the characters address rather than having us to do that work - and that makes this a far more relaxed, if that word can be used about Ingmar Bergman - and gentle rummage through his theological baggage. The plot is busy and entertaining, and there are plenty of other characters enmeshed in the narrative that give us an opportunity to come up for a breather now and again, and I think this might be one of my favourites from this man.']"

The fat guy who freezes atop a climbing frame is the central plot here with Matthew Modine\'s character playing second fiddle to all of the _Leslie Barbara_ stuff.\r\n\r\nThe second half of the movie at least gives us something we were not expecting when a sniper\'s identity is revealed.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Ian Beale', 'Released in 1986, <i>Full Metal Jacket</i> is Stanley Kubrick\'s film about Vietnam, adapted from a novel by the reclusive and bitter Vietnam veteran Gustav Harford, and then further expanded by acclaimed Vietnam journalist Michael Herr.\r\n\r\nThe film breaks down neatly into two very different parts, though both are seen through the eyes of young United States marine J. T. ""Joker"" Davis (Matthew Modine). In the first act, Davis makes his way through Marine basic training with a motley group of other recruits under the hellish command of gunnery sergeant Hartmann (R. Lee Ermey). Joker watches as Hartmann bullies an overweight and dim-witted recruit cruelly nicknamed Gomer Pyle (Vincent D\'Onofrio), until Pyle explodes into murderous revenge. In the second act, now set in Vietnam where Joker is doing a tour of duty as a military journalist, the protagonist and his fellow Marines find themselves on the front line during the Tet Offensive and Joker witnesses firsthand the savagery of war.\r\n\r\nFew films consist of such drastically opposed parts that differ in setting and tone and don’t have any overlapping characters besides the protagonist (and one minor character from the boot camp scenes). <i>Full Metal Jacket</i> has often disappointed viewers because the first half is so thrilling that it proves a hard act to follow. That\'s all down to R.&nbsp;Lee Ermey, who actually was a drill instructor during Vietnam and initially served only as a technical consultant before Kubrick decided to let him play the role and improvise. Ermey acts with a white-hot intensity, realism, and brilliantly worded insults and obscenities that no screenwriter could ever have come up with.\r\n\r\nAs a young man, I too felt that the film was a letdown once it moved past the witty quips and goofy camaraderie of the boot camp scenes. With time, however, my appreciation for the film as a whole has only grown. The two-part structure now seems to be a strong yin-yang structure: the first act is a vision of order, while the second is all chaos. Furthermore, the second half is a moving statement of how war is often senseless. Joker and his squad, while on patrol for an enemy they cannot even identify and whose ideology or culture they know hardly anything of, begin to be targeted by a sniper. Several men perish before the sniper is found and neutralized, and all that death is pointless: it doesn\'t contribute in any way to victory for either side. The brutality of World War I trench warfare, where dozens of men could perish for merely a foot of conquered ground, is shown to have persisted through the American quagmire in Southeast Asia.\r\n\r\nThat said, the film does have its flaws. One is the unrealistic depiction of the Vietnamese landscape. Kubrick had a great fear or dislike of foreign travel, and he insisted on shooting the whole film in East London. Having merely a few palm trees shipped in is a poor replacement for a real Southeast Asian shooting location with its humidity and insects, and in the scene that is meant to show a lively Vietnamese town square Kubrick obviously had the same few cars driving around in circles. It\'s strange how a director who was generally so perfectionist, could be so careless about locales (this only got worse with his next and last film, <i>Eyes Wide Shut</i>, with its inauthentic stage set New York City). There are also some anachronisms that this director and his technical advisors should have noticed.\r\n\r\nStill, even a flawed Kubrick film is classic cinema.', 'The Marine\'s don\'t want robots - they want killers.\r\n\r\nThis is the journey undertaken by Private ""Joker"" J.T. Davis, from brutal training camp to Vietnam itself.\r\n\r\nAs most people know by now, Full Metal Jacket is divided very much into two different halves, halves that to me show the best and worst of the talented director, Stanley Kubrick. For the first part we are subjected to the training regime inflicted on wet behind the ears boys, boys soon to become Marines out in the harshness of the Vietnam War. This is real dehumanising stuff, frighteningly essayed by the brilliance of drill instructor R Lee Ermey\'s performance. We know, see and feel that the boys are primed to be killing machines, unemotional killing machines at that, with Kubrick astutely weaving the brutality of camp into the moral quandary that was the war itself. One particular recruit, Private Gomer (a heartfelt and unnervingly great Vincent D\'Onofrio) is the film, and Gustav Hasford\'s (writer of the novel and co screenwriter here) point of reference in this incredible first half. It\'s with this strand that ""Jacket"" burns itself into the soul of the viewer, to hopefully set us up for what will be Private ""Joker\'s"" (Matthew Modine) preparation for the Vietnam conflict.\r\n\r\nThen it\'s that second half...\r\n\r\nWhere do we go from here? We already know that ""Joker"" and his mentally brutalised colleagues have been stripped of their basic humanity. Soldiers primed to kill, it\'s harsh, but true. But Kubrick has already chilled our blood and bludgeoned us repeatedly courtesy of the ""Boot Camp"" set up. Modine\'s (who isn\'t strong enough to carry the picture) ""Joker"" is now the film\'s axis, a clever, most definitely articulate character, who is thrust into the murky and muddled battle of the Tet Offensive, yeah and so? All it amounts to is a prolonged series of rationale and philosophical musings on the false war. Kubrick even shifting to safe mode with a clumsy narration segment spouted by ""Joker"".\r\n\r\nFull Metal Jacket is a truly fine film, but it\'s not the brilliant one it really should have been. If one can take the time to venture deeper with the second half, then it doesn\'t deliver on the already made point promise of the first part. Technically it\'s flawless, incredibly designed, with Douglas Milsome\'s cinematography stunningly effective. But I\'ll maintain to my final day that Full Metal Jacket finished up as being bloody and pretty instead of being a poignant and horrifying masterpiece. 7/10']"

It's a gorgeous, quiet masterwork - Luca Guadagnino has given us something truly special here. I'll cherish this one for a long, long time as it's extremely human and very personal. The fact that the legendary James Ivory wrote the screenplay for this shoots this over the top and slam dunks it into the cinematic stratosphere. Truly stunning work that deserves to be remembered, preserved, and celebrated for decades to come.\r\n\r\nThe performances in this are so mesmerizing. I've never liked Armie Hammer as much as I like him in this. He really embodies his character and it's a lived in, fully realized performance. Timothée Chalamet - who has a great year ahead of him with other big projects - is absolutely captivating as the young lead in this coming-of-age tale. I've seen many a coming-of-age film, but this one is one of the truest portrayals of a gay youth coming to terms with his sexuality, emotions, and his own body.\r\n\r\nThere are so many phenomenal scenes, but the one that stands out above the rest - and the one that made me cry in a theatre full of festivalgoers - is Michael Stuhlbarg's final monologue. It's one of the most honest and real moments I've seen in any film and one of the best father and son moments too. Crossing my fingers so hard that this becomes a huge critical darling and garners some attention come awards time (specifically for Guadagnino, Ivory, Chalamet, and Stuhlbarg).\r\n\r\nOh, and bonus points for that final shot of Chalamet's face as the credits roll. It's the best of its kind since Glazer's _Birth_ in 2004 when Nicole Kidman shattered all of our souls. Chalamet does the same thing here and it's overwhelmingly stunning."", ""A near-perfect, timeless movie which will be responsible for many tears and yeast infections. Languid small-town living is captured perfectly, as is the tentative romance between the leads. I can't think of any substantive criticism until the last 25 minutes, when the movie becomes sloppy, less of a climax than a dissipation. (And personally, I'd have liked to see a sliver more of sexuality, which is oddly lacking.) Still, it's good. Watch it."", 'Amidst some beautiful Italian rusticity, we are introdcued to the ""Perlman"" family. It\'s the father (Michael Stuhlbarg) who has employed American ""Oliver"" (Armie Hammer) to help out with some research, and that involves living-in with his family of wife ""Annella"" (Amira Casar) and teenage son ""Elio"" (Timothée Chalamet) at their villa. Initially, they just call him ""later"" as that\'s his most often used expression as he takes his leave, but gradually they take to this man who appears to have depths that bely his slightly friendly but diffident attitude. It\'s the young ""Elio"" who seems most smitten. He\'s only seventeen but has a maturity that seems beyond his years as he uses his own substantial polyglot intellect to engage with their visitor. Though he\'s flirting like mad with his childhood friend ""Marzia"" (Esther Garrel) it\'s quite clear that his relationship with ""Oliver"" is passing the infatuation stage and heading into uncharted territory for both men - and the onlooking parents. With the sun shining, the wine flowing and the swimming tempting, Luca Guadagnino now takes us on a beautifully crafted story that is more than a rite of passage, or a typical ""coming of age"" drama - it\'s a love story that I felt at times was joyous and optimistic and yet, ultimately, somewhat cruel. The outwardly confident ""Elio"" has been raised in a loving and tactile family environment and so finds this emotional exposure he now faces both exhilarating and terrifying, and the sylphlike Chalamet really does deliver that vulnerability - and playfulness - like an experienced hand, whilst Hammer walks a path that I was never quite sure of. Is he just playing games with the young man, does he really care? Is it all just to pass the time during his visit or it it more? The location settings are gorgeous and the combination of a sparing script from James Ivory and some poignantly mixed musical themes ranging from Bach to Giorgio Moroder contribute to an aesthetic that is both ideally sheltering and yet hot-blooded at the same time. This is a film that seems to get better with age, and for just over two hours we are immersed in something that\'s really quite natural.']"

Controversy became a banal word in this debate, especially regarding the decision of exclusively distributing blockbusters and highly-anticipated films through Netflix, HBO, Disney+, Apple TV+, and more. Concerning this matter, I will always defend the theater experience as something unique and incomparable with home viewing, at least in a general way. Nevertheless, I think the most comprehensible path to accommodate everyone is to give the viewer both choices, and I firmly believe that would be the new norm, sooner or later.\r\n\r\nWhy this apparently unrelated prologue? Well, Palmer is exclusively premiering on Apple TV+, which is probably the most underrated streaming service out there. Both their original movies (Wolfwalkers, On the Rocks) and TV shows (Servant) have become more and more successful, and their production quality unquestionably makes dozens of studios jealous. With that in mind, I believe an indie flick with a narrative like Palmer’s would always suffer at the box-office in a standard theatrical distribution, so I’m genuinely glad Apple caught it because I wouldn’t be surprised if it ends up as one of my favorite films of the year.\r\n\r\nI’ve seen Fisher Stevens before, but never in the director’s chair. I’m surprised at how much this movie positively impacted me. Cheryl Guerriero’s screenplay might not be groundbreaking or incredibly innovative, but it follows an extremely efficient formula that, when written and directed in the right manner, hits most viewers’ hearts. Boasting well-written, captivating dialogues that feel real, Palmer tells a cliche yet fascinating story featuring two exceptionally inspiring characters who can undoubtedly serve as a beautiful influence to many viewers going through similar life issues.\r\n\r\nRyder Allen interprets Sam, a bullied kid with a remarkable amount of self-confidence and pride, even though he lives in a trailer with terrible parents and is made fun of by his school colleagues. He doesn’t let other people control his choices or what he likes, independently of what happens. His will and ultimate happiness in dressing up as a princess, having tea parties, or simply being “different” from everyone else (as described in the film) can have an extraordinary result in the audience, mainly kids. Regarding Ryder’s performance, I have no doubt he will be a heavy contender in categories concerning young actors since he delivers a heartfelt display that made me tear up by the end of the movie.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to his adult counterpart, Justin Timberlake portrays Eddie Palmer, an ex-convict trying to get back on track after losing over a decade of his life due to an admittedly grave crime. However, as the character is presented and developed throughout the runtime, it becomes relatively easy to emotionally connect with Palmer. Even though his imprisonment was more than fair, Palmer demonstrates to be an altruistic, loving person who truly wants to redeem himself while admitting that he’s far from being considered “normal”, consequently creating an unbreakable bond with Sam. Timberlake genuinely surprised me with a grounded, experienced performance.\r\n\r\nIn the end, it’s the astonishingly honest connection between Palmer and Sam that elevate the screenplay into such an inspirational narrative. There are other impactful and interesting relationships, namely between Palmer and Maggie Hayes (Alisha Wainwright), as well as between Palmer and his grandmother, Vivian (June Squibb). These characters significantly impact Palmer’s life, and the actresses were up to the task. However, Shelly (Juno Temple) is a terrible parent who I couldn’t feel sorry for, not even after certain acts of compassion that are meant for the viewers to forgive the character. Technically, just a quick praise to Tamar-kali’s subtle score that hit me in the right moments.\r\n\r\nI sincerely hope that this Fisher Stevens’ indie flick finds its audience at home because it’s a heartwarming, enlightening, emotionally compelling story of redemption and self-acceptance. Palmer might follow a generic formula that any viewer has seen at least a few dozen times, but Cheryl Guerriero’s well-written, efficient screenplay is brought to life in an incredibly authentic, genuine manner. The wonderful bond between Justin Timberlake and Ryder Allen’s characters is the film’s heart and soul. Both actors deliver outstanding performances, as well as the rest of the cast, but it’s the cliche yet heartfelt narrative packed with meaningful messages that ultimately brings up tears to the eyes. Despite the failed attempt to make the viewer feel compassion for Juno Temple’s character, Apple TV+ offers another highly commendable movie to watch with your family.\r\n\r\nRating: A-', '“Palmer” is the type of conventional, formulaic movie that’s designed for audiences who don’t appreciate surprises. This redemption story about an ex-con who bonds with a misfit kid follows a tried-and-true blueprint that’s predictable and saccharine sweet, but the film has an honorable message of understanding and acceptance that celebrates unity — even if it does so on the most basic level.\r\n\r\nFormer high school football star Eddie Palmer (Justin Timberlake) had his whole life ahead of him until a violent mistake turned the All-American boy into a convicted felon. After spending 12 years in prison, Palmer returns home to Louisiana and moves in with his grandmother Vivian (June Squibb). Grandma has taken a liking to the unusual 7-year-old boy named Sam (Ryder Allen) who is living next door with his deadbeat druggie mother, Shelly (Juno Temple). When the boy’s mom runs off for a much longer time than usual, Sam temporarily moves in with his neighbors.\r\n\r\nCircumstances change for everyone in the weeks that follow, and Palmer begins to notice that he and the eccentric young boy have more in common than either of them first thought. These two outcasts form a strong bond, each of them making a fresh start with their lives.\r\n\r\nThe idea of a child who doesn’t conform to gender norms isn’t exactly a challenging topic for most of us in 2021, but the film is so charming that it could break through to the very people who need to be given a gentle nudge and lesson in acceptance. In fact, at first I thought this was a faith-based movie (until the sex scenes and swearing started).\r\n\r\nTimberlake and Allen have a sweet chemistry that is essential for a buddy movie like this to work. There are a lot of emotional bits that border on corny, but the film still doesn’t seem too artificial.

The main thieves are played by Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi, Michael Madsen and Chris Penn while Lawrence Tierney appears as the old salt mastermind.\r\n\r\nThis was Tarantino’s first feature film, costing only $1,200,000, and it has quirky glimmerings of future greatness, as seen in “Pulp Fiction” (1994), “Jackie Brown” (1997), “Kill Bill” (2003/2004), “Inglourious Basterds” (2009) and “Django Unchained” (2012), but “Reservoir” didn’t work for me. It’s hampered by a low-budget vibe, which I can handle, but not the uninteresting lowlife characters, their self-made conundrum, their interminably dull dialogue and the one-dimensional setting where about 80% of the story takes place in an old warehouse, not to mention no females in the main cast.\r\n\r\nStill, it’s interesting to observe Tarantino’s first serious stab at filmmaking and it has its moments of genuine entertainment. It’s a lesson on humble beginnings, which shows potential while not being up to snuff.\r\n\r\nTHE FILM RUNS 1 hour, 39 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles & Burbank.\r\n\r\nGRADE: C-', 'Nope, I didn\'t get the memo...

What now ensues is a recreation of the planning and execution of their raid, their introductions to each other and that all lays the seeds for this over-rated drama of brutal mistrust and duplicity.

Some offered me a blast of pure entertainment, others left me crying like a baby, and dozens made me laugh uncontrollably. Nevertheless, the most memorable movies are the ones that profoundly impact me emotionally either by remembering me of a past phase of my life or by possessing main characters who I can strongly relate to. What might be ""just another film"" for most viewers can ultimately become a personal journey for other people in the audience, which is how I partially experienced The Father. I didn\'t have massive expectations for the movie itself, but I was curious to know how great Anthony Hopkins would be.\r\n\r\nWhile the legendary actor is undoubtedly a notable standout, Florian Zeller\'s creative, unconventional storytelling left me completely floored. By the end of the film, I felt emotionally drained of all my feelings and thoughts due to the increasingly heavier, devastating narrative co-written by Zeller and Christopher Hampton, adapted from the former\'s award-winning play, Le Père. This could have been yet another generic story about dementia, but Zeller\'s brilliant storytelling places the viewer in the protagonist\'s skin, offering a terrifying viewpoint of the disease. From the very first minute until the end, the spectators accompany Anthony, an old man starting to lose track of reality, through his own perspective.\r\n\r\nI genuinely don\'t know if this sort of point of view has been depicted before, particularly in the case of dementia, but either way, it\'s a harrowing experience that will surely leave a vast majority of its viewers extremely captivated throughout the entire runtime. Watching Anthony go through scenes that he wholly believes are indeed happening as he sees them is as attention-grabbing as it is frustrating and sad once the audience gets to see how the same scenes really played out. In fact, if one starts watching the movie without even knowing the synopsis, the first act will almost seem like a mystery-thriller due to so many twists and turns regarding previous conversations that Anthony and the viewers believe are 100% real.\r\n\r\nZeller and Hampton\'s script doesn\'t only approach Anthony\'s feelings but also the loved ones surrounding him, which I firmly believe was both necessary and honest. The Father doesn\'t shy away from showing the boiled-up frustration and even desperation that the family usually goes through when dealing with someone with this terrible health condition. I have no words to describe how thoughtful and impactful Zeller\'s storytelling method ends up being. I found myself remarkably surprised once I realized the film had reached the one-hour mark. The control of the movie\'s pacing and tone is absolutely seamless. Technically, Yorgos Lamprinos\' editing work is as impeccable as Ben Smithard\'s lingering cinematography.\r\n\r\nHowever, it\'s Ludovico Einaudi\'s outstanding score that steals the spotlight in the technical realm. From the atmospheric, grand opera music to the more subtle tracks, Einaudi makes sure to elevate the critical moments with a noticeable sound that helps the viewer understand the progressive shift in Anthony\'s perception of reality. Zeller demonstrates immense talent in his feature film directorial debut. Being an adaptation from his own play certainly aids him in bringing the story from stage-to-screen, but his filmmaking choices are worthy of recognition, such as the extensive use of long takes to let the actors shine in their layered roles. And since I mentioned the cast...\r\n\r\nAnthony Hopkins delivers an award-worthy performance that only finds in Chadwick Boseman (Ma Rainey\'s Black Bottom) a serious rival for this year\'s awards season. Hopkins holds countless astonishing displays throughout his career, but this one is definitely one of my favorites. I never anticipated I\'d shed so many tears by watching an old man cry or getting slapped in the face, though it\'s not even due to the acts themselves but to everything that builds up those moments. During most of the runtime, I don\'t really feel sadness or anger. Instead, I feel every character\'s pain because it\'s incredibly hard to watch how everyone deals with the situation. Hopkins and Olivia Colman are undoubtedly the most impactful, but Olivia Williams and Imogen Poots also add a lot to the sentimental component.\r\n\r\nI insinuate above that The Father impacted me at a personal level. A little bit about my life: my grandfather didn\'t have dementia, but his mind slowly deteriorated until it reached a point where he had to spend his last few months on this planet stuck in a bed without really talking or moving. Still to this day, part of me regrets not spending that much time with him near the end, while the other part feels a bit relieved that my memory of him in his ""normal"" state remains intact. I always feared that if I visited him often in his last days of living, I\'d only remember his time at the nursing home instead of the years packed with tremendously essential lessons he taught me. This movie left me sleepless, spending the night thinking about that time of my life...\r\n\r\nThe Father is an overwhelmingly devastating depiction of the painfully progressive disease that is dementia. Florian Zeller\'s extremely captivating storytelling places the viewers inside the protagonist\'s mind, making the audience witness and feel everything through his unclear perspective. Zeller and Christopher Hampton deliver a brilliantly unique screenplay packed with emotional punches that will leave no one indifferent. From the perfect editing to the persistent camera work, it\'s Ludovico Einaudi\'s gorgeous, impactful score that elevates the big moments. Zeller\'s use of long takes feels both necessary and important to attach the viewers\' attention to Anthony Hopkins, who delivers an award-worthy, powerfully compelling performance. One of my favorites of his entire career. Hopefully, this will be the closest I\'ll ever be to experience this mental condition. My personal connection to this film justifies why I\'ll offer it my highest rating since November 2019 (Ford v Ferrari). One of the best movies I\'ve seen in the last couple of years. Do not miss it!\r\n\r\nRating: A+', '“The Father” gives its audience a fully immersive experience with the frustrations of dementia in this stage-to-screen adaptation of Florian Zeller‘s 2012 play. Making his feature film directorial debut, Zeller gives the project a personal touch with much emotional gravity, as he’s so intimate with the source material. The film has the look and feel of a stage play, but it thrusts audiences into the main character’s head in a way that only the medium can achieve.\r\n\r\nAnthony (Anthony Hopkins) is growing increasingly confused in his day-to-day activities. At first he can’t remember where he left his watch, but later he doesn’t know if it’s morning or night. The man sometimes doesn’t recognize his daughter Anne (Olivia Colman), and he confuses his caregiver Laura (Imogen Poots) with others in his life with increasing frequency. As Anthony’s mind continues to decline at an alarming rate, he starts to have severe mood swings that are brought on from the frustration of his lifetime of memories slipping away. He refuses assistance from Anne, who is trying her best to help him cope. Change is never easy, but Anthony’s paranoia grows as the fabric of his reality unravels.\r\n\r\nThe film features excellent turns from Hopkins and Coleman, two seasoned actors who carry the dialogue-heavy film. It’s fantastic work from both of them. Zeller puts viewers into Anthony’s shoes, adopting the old man’s mental state as he questions what’s real and what’s imagined. You’ll begin to wonder if his daughter and nurse are playing cruel games on him, with a sense of doubt that’s contagious. Something isn’t quite right, and the conflicting distractions offer a puzzle with no easy solution.\r\n\r\nThe intentional misdirection is a bit gimmicky and the pacing slow, but “The Father” paints a poignant and effective (if depressing) picture from the point of view of a person struggling with dementia.', ""'The Father' is a standout during this very bland awards season, but just because it's both a critical darling and awards frontrunner doesn't take away from the emotional power and stellar performances for Colman and Hopkins.\r\n- Chris dos Santos\r\n\r\nRead Chris' full article...\r\nhttps://www.maketheswitch.com.au/article/review-the-father-a-deeply-moving-look-at-mental-illness"", ""Incredible performances from Anthony Hopkins and Olivia Colman!\r\n\r\n<em>'The Father'</em> makes for a rather heart-breaking watch, it's very clear from the get-go where the film is heading but that doesn't stop it hitting directly in the feels. I've fortunately never been around someone with what this film depicts, yet it still came across as very realistic - based on what I have heard about the condition.\r\n\r\nHopkins is utterly superb in the lead role, which is what I expected given I had heard about this 2020 flick back when it won the big gongs. Something I hadn't heard about, though, was Colman's performance - which is absolutely fantastic, particularly in one emotional scene alongside Hopkins and Imogen Poots.\r\n\r\nA very saddening but brilliant film, cleverly portrayed too."", '‘The Father’ is an incredibly moving film that leaves you as confused in time and place as the main character (an incredible Hopkins), allowing the audience to experience - if only a little - what it must feel like to have dementia.\r\n\r\n9/10', ""Anthony Hopkins's performance in The Father is bulletproof. This is fortunate, because he encounters what the military calls 'friendly fire' resulting from a baffling decision by co-writer/director Florian Zeller, who has a couple of characters played each by two different sets of actors.\r\n\r\nThus Anne, Hopkins’s character’s (also named Anthony) daughter is played by Olivia Williams and Olivia Colman (who at least share some physical resemblance), while Anne's (ex)husband Paul is played by Rufus Sewell and Mark Gattis (who are like day and night). No wonder Anthony is so confused – as are we.\r\n\r\nThere are certainly precedents for this type of casting, the most famous of which is That Obscure Object of Desire, in which Luis Buñuel alternates the role of Conchita between Carole Bouquet and Ángela Molina – but then Buñuel was a prankster, whereas The Father's theme of senile dementia is very serious and deserves to be treated accordingly.\r\n\r\nNow, I’m aware that it’s only natural for Anthony to think that his nurse is also his daughter, but the source of his confusion should be that the person he believes to be his daughter behaves like a nurse, and not the other way around. It would make more sense, comparatively, for Colman to play Anne and the nurse, and for Williams to only play the nurse, but not Anne.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it doesn't make sense that the first time Anthony fails to recognize Anne we can't recognize her either, because then we think there’s something fishy going on. It would be far more dramatically effective if the actress Anthony doesn't recognize as his daughter is the one and only whom we identify as Anne. The protagonists turmoil is internal, and it’s Hopkins's duty to externalize it – of which the actor does a flawless job.\r\n\r\nThe film's mise-en-scène works better to convey Anthony's cognitive impairment but, again, it is the character's mental feng shui, or lack thereof, that interests us, and which Hopkins expresses unequivocally through a masterful combination of oral and body language. It’s not that he's the best part of the movie; he is the movie.\r\n\r\nHopkins puts on the proverbial clinic; his is a heartbreakingly beautiful performance, a veritable emotional roller coaster with sudden highs and unexpected lows. The Briton’s acting is all the more impressive because he makes it look easy – I mean, like Brando easy.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, it's as if Zeller doesn't quite trust Hopkins to make his vision a reality, hence all the visual gimmickry that hurts more than it helps (to paraphrase Jorge Luis Borges, saying something too much is as bad as not saying it). This is most unfortunate because Hopkins's talent for storytelling remains as powerful as ever – perhaps even more so."", 'We, as ""normal"" people, cannot imagine what really goes on inside the head of those suffering from more advanced dementia. We only know for sure what is reflected by caretakers and psychiatrists. Yet, Florian Zeller has done a tremendous job of immersing us in what may be the experience of one suffering individual. As a caretaker of two parents who both went this way, it is about as accurate an experience as we will ever come to understand. This is a powerful drama, made real by an absolutely amazing acting by Anthony Hopkins.', ""The Father is a brilliant film. Fantastic performances all around, amazing editing, and cinematography that creates confusion for not only the audience but our main character. This story is so touching and incredibly tragic, it had me tearing up at multiple points. Not only do the emotional points work, but this film also creates an almost horror aspect of Alzheimer's that is quite frightening. It really made me sympathize for those with this disease and fear for the potential future of myself losing my memory.\r\n\r\nScore: 92% | \r\nVerdict: Excellent""]"

I love pretty much everything that Pixar puts out, and at the start of 2020, I noticed that the studio was releasing not one but two original animated movies, something quite uncommon in their history (only happened in 2015 and 2017). Onward was yet another success, but everyone knew Soul was the studio\'s big gun. December release date means better chances to win an Oscar, and the highly anticipated return of Pete Docter (Monsters Inc., Up, Inside Out) to the director and writer\'s chairs also elevates the film\'s expectations.\r\n\r\nI\'m no different. My expectations were high as the sky, but the main question in my mind wasn\'t really if Soul was going to be a great movie, but if it would be so good I\'d love it more than Wolfwalkers, my favorite animated flick of the year so far? Well, let me write that it\'s a wonderful, beautiful, heartwarming tie. I love them both very much, and I wouldn\'t be surprised if I saw them in my Top10. However, this is Soul\'s spotlight, so let me get to it, and spit out the only minor issue I have with the film. During the first act, I couldn\'t feel a connection to the story nor the characters. It took me a while to really get fully invested in the narrative, and even technical aspects such as the animation style and the score (Trent Reznor, Atticus Ross) felt weirdly out-of-place and surprisingly not that enthralling.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, this slow, unconvincing beginning doesn\'t negatively impact the movie overall, as most of these apparently awkward components improve as time goes by. From the moment it clicked with me, I went on that emotional rollercoaster I always expect to ride in a Pixar feature. The studio is known for its extremely heartfelt, shocking, tear-inducing third acts, and even though Soul isn\'t an exception to that rule, it\'s far from being one of those mind-blowing, jaw-dropping, devastating final minutes. Its third act is astonishingly emotional, and it sends a lovely message to the audience, one that made me reflect on the entire year and a specific moment in my life.\r\n\r\nPete Docter, Mike Jones, and Kemp Powers explore the taboo subject of life\'s meaning in a predictable yet profound and entertaining manner. The approach on philosophical questions like ""what\'s my purpose?"", ""what\'s my spark?"", or ""what does it mean to have a soul?"" is cleverly developed and very well-written. There\'s a sequence with the protagonist near the end that will make tons of viewers experience it simultaneously. I found myself rewatching this scene in particular to help me remember a certain period in my life where I realized that what I thought was my destiny was, in fact, just one of those life passions that leave us with unforgettable memories.\r\n\r\nI was able to deal with that moment pretty well, but many people lose themselves once they figure out that what they thought they were meant to do/be isn\'t really what the future holds for them. They become lost souls, and only a spark of life can revitalize them. Soul explores this matter in such an authentic, genuine, creative way that I couldn\'t help but cry as I do in every Pixar film. Watching Soul will make you appreciate life a lot more, especially those tiny, little moments that we forget to remember. Living, with all its horrible phases, is the best life experience anyone can have. After a year of isolation and separation from the people we love, this movie arrives at the perfect time.\r\n\r\nTechnically, the animation style and score didn\'t convince me in the first few minutes, but by the end, they\'re part of the key aspects that made me cry like a baby. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross are starting to become two of my favorite composers (The Social Network, Gone Girl, Mank). Pete Docter proves that his undeniable talent behind the screen remains intact, and this time, he introduces Hollywood to the debutants Kemp Powers and Mike Jones. Jamie Foxx and Tina Fey (22) deliver some terrific voice work, so expect them to receive dozens of nominations. Finally, congratulations to every single artist that worked on this film\'s animation. These gifted people are the real stars of Pixar.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Soul is everything I expected it to be. A classic Pixar feature, with the trademark emotionally powerful third act; a heartwarming, sweet, tear-inducing score; and a relatable, profound, well-explored story about our own soul and the meaning of life. Pete Docter delivers another award-worthy flick with the help of Kemp Powers and Mike Jones, and with the outstanding voices of Jamie Foxx and Tina Fey. It may start slow and follow a predictable path, but it\'s only a matter of time until every viewer connects with the main characters. Soul surpasses the barriers of cinema, becoming a healing media from which people can take away so, so much. It works seamlessly as a reflection on life, and as a motivation to truly live every single moment of it. It\'s the ideal movie to watch on the morning of Christmas Day with the entire family cozy and warm in the living room. I promise you: it will make you enjoy this festive season a lot more. Undoubtedly, one of the best films of the year.\r\n\r\nRating: A', ""This is my favorite Disney Pixar movie, even beating Monster's Inc!\r\n\r\nThere wasn't a minute where I wasn't enjoying the movie, there's very powerful meaning to this movie (that will go over kids' heads) and for once, it (in my opinion) tackles an issue big with teens and adults more than kids (at least more than usually).\r\n\r\nThe movie's message is (from what I understood it anyway) about anxiety, sadness, and fear of how you choose your life path. Even going as far as showing how you're so-called purpose in life may not even be correct (or real to begin with).\r\n\r\nThis is by the creators of Inside Out, which gave really good messages across about feelings. It was more kid-oriented, so Soul (in my opinion) being more about teens or adults was a surprise that I did not expect. I'm not saying this isn't a kids movie, I'm saying you shouldn't avoid it if you're not a kid.\r\n\r\nIt probably helps this movie that it's got it's messages across with Music as an instrument (get it?), as I too love music heavily including all kinds of genres (seriously, if you saw my YouTube music history you would think I'm somewhere between a 5-year-old girl, to a 101-year-old Beatles fan).\r\n\r\nI seriously recommend giving this one a watch."", ""In a year where most of us have been trapped indoors, the timing of 'Soul's' release can be seen as either a blessing or a curse. For some, it will act as a calming balm for a tough year; the perfect vehicle for inducing a good cry. Others, on the other hand, may reject it as yet another unnecessary mirror held up to their biggest fears exacerbated by a year where living with perceived “purpose“ has been near impossible. No matter which side of this you fall on, 'Soul' implores you to find beauty and gratitude in your circumstances. There is no doubt that is by far the best film Pixar has released in years - possibly even this decade.\r\n- Ashley Teresa\r\n\r\nRead Ashley's full article...\r\nhttps://www.maketheswitch.com.au/article/review-soul-pixars-finest-work-in-years"", 'Soul is the latest effort by Disney Pixar, a beautiful and wonderful film that will leave anyone to ponder about life, its value and the magic inherent in existence. \r\n\r\nThe film tells the story of a man who accidentally falls into a ditch and ""dies"". However, he does not accept his death and begins a journey into his own afterlife until he is able to reunite with his body, in a coma on earth. \r\n\r\nFor a children\'s film, Soul is surprisingly deep, perhaps even too deep, especially for a child. The film touches on various existential themes, from purpose to the meaning of life, and will make us lose ourselves in thoughts about our own life.\r\n\r\nThe characters are a marvel, especially the protagonists, because they are complete with complex layers that give us all kinds of feelings. The voices that bring them to life do an excellent job in making all the emotions that pass through them appear. \r\n\r\nWhen it comes to animation, once again Pixar exceeds itself and brings us a film that is a living work of art, each frame a beautiful picture of colours and movement that extends for two hours. It\'s really magical to see life on the small screen, the realism in some of the scenes will leave the audience really amazed. \r\n\r\nThe smaller ones, however, may not understand the complexity of the film, and I don\'t feel that this is exactly the most entertaining film that will make them pay attention in 100% of the scenes, much due to the fact that it is not necessarily as energetic as many of the most watched animated films in recent years. It is, however, a valuable lesson that is present in the film, and letting children try to understand it will be the right choice to make when viewing Soul. \r\n\r\nAll in all, this effort by Pixar is worthwhile, wonderful, beautiful and moving. The truth is, I found myself reevaluating my whole life and pondering the fact that time is money, because time is life.', 'Really good watch, would watch again, and can recommend.\r\n\r\nI\'ll have to admit, I went into this thinking it would be Disney\'s yearly racist progressive attempt, so the bar was pretty low.\r\n\r\nThe movie is actually delightful, and shockingly deep.  The title indicates it has to do with the human soul, so I was expecting something along the lines of ""Inside"" or having to do with jazz, and while it has a rather nice combination of those two things, the attempt on the deep inner workings of the universe in the ""inbetween"" is incredible.\r\n\r\nI imagine everyone will have their own interpretations of what the movie represents mechanically, but the story itself focuses on the pursuit of dreams and happiness combined with the experience of life.\r\n\r\nThe movie animation is fantastic and the voice actors are all top shelf.  The story is awesome, and the characters are strong, deep, and interesting.  I find it hard to believe that anyone would actually not like the movie.\r\n\r\nThe structure is a little basic for something so fantastical, but I think that\'s by design to keep appeal to most audiences that expect a general family Disney format.', 'Pleasant film.\r\n\r\n<em>\'Soul\'</em> didn\'t connect with me on any deep level, but it is an undoubtedly sweet film. It attempts a lot of heart and I respect that. Jamie Foxx has been in some of my favourite films and he is good as Joe here. I also like the casting of Graham Norton as Moonwind.\r\n\r\nOne thing that probably stopped me thoroughly enjoying this is the animation and character design, particularly when in the ""Great Beyond"". It\'s not that it looks bad, or anything close, but I just found it a bit too plain. I never felt attached to any of the characters or settings there. I did, though, enjoy the sounds and music, especially in the aforementioned afterlife area. They do do that nicely.\r\n\r\nIt\'s definitely a good film and one with a nice and honourable message, I just needed that something extra to enjoy it more personally.', ""I watched a cartoon with children. Kind and deep cartoon. I liked the humor, especially when the hero's soul moved into the cat. I recommend it for family viewing"", 'Now this is not my favourite style of animation, I find it all a little unnatural to watch. That said, though, this is a charming story that follows the life of a music teacher who really just wants to play his beloved jazz. ""Joe"" finally gets an opportunity to tinkle the ivories with the band of the renowned ""Dorothea"". She like shim, he likes her - then an accident befalls and in best ""Matter of Life and Death"" tradition, he is on a conveyor belt to the afterlife. Determined not to follow the masses of other dead folks, he jumps from the pathway and ends up in a curious plane of existence that is designed to train new souls for exportation to newborns arriving on Earth. Shrewdly, he manages to capitalise on this administration mix-up and become a mentor - to the unruly and pretty irredeemable ""22"". After a bit of bargaining, the latter, who has been there for aeons and has no interest at all in being ""born"" - agrees to help the former to get back to Earth in the right body. What ensues now are a series of characterful escapades that see them flirt with rebirth (only in swapped bodies) but that ultimately cause both to re-assess what their priorities are. Of course there\'s some moralising - it\'s Disney - but that is delivered quite subtly and wrapped in some entertainingly witty dialogue and some - though not enough - gorgeous jazz. There\'s not much doubt as to the conclusion, but along the way we find a story that\'s optimistic, life-affirming and does rather encourage people to count their blessings.

It could have been so bad, but the film somehow pulls it off with crazy stunts, an amazing cast and a great story. \r\n\r\nThe film really tackles the fate of humanity straight on which gets you thinking about our path as a species but also what we can do today to change things. The story takes you on a journey which is one of the most believable time travel movies of all time.\r\n\r\nThe action scenes are fantastic, with wall to wall fighting, car chases and military maneuvers that will keep you on the edge of your seat. That's mixed with a great cast and brilliant story telling from the directory. I would say its even better than the first movie which is also a classic.\r\n\r\nOverall I have probably seen this movie 20 or 30 times over the last 25 years(go is it that long!!) and still don't get bored. Its a timeless classic that I urge everyone to watch."", ""While I am in that minority which believes it is actually the first _Terminator_ movie which is the best of the franchise, don't let that for one minute convince you I don't absolutely love _Judgement Day_. It's honestly pretty crazy to me how just bonkers good these first two _Terminator_ movies are. Especially when you consider how completely every single sequel managed to miss the mark.\r\n\r\nI like to imagine that in the Good Timeline, where everything isn't Terrible™, this movie is exactly the same, but the trailer doesn't spoil the twist about Robert Patrick being a Terminator and Arnie being a good guy. I know that they also spoil the twist about who's a Terminator and who's not and who's a bad guy and who's not in the trailers for the 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th too, but I'm pretty sure that in the Good Timeline those never got made, so whatever.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:★★★★½ - Ridiculously strong appeal. I can’t stop thinking about it._"", 'Great watch, will watch again, and can recommend.\r\n\r\nThis is everything the original was turned up one notch.  Now Arnold is a caring unfeeling robot, and we missed a whole movie where Sarah Connor went hard into training.\r\n\r\nThis has twists, escapes, a liquid terminator, better special and practical effects, some big explosions, active discussion of how to change the future, and some really iconic moments.\r\n\r\nThe movie isn\'t chatty in the traditional sense, once Arnold gets involved, all the dialogue outside the asylum is very much to mechanically move the plot forward.  The terminators don\'t voluntary ""chat"", they more vomit exposition dialogue.\r\n\r\nWhile I\'ll always remember this as a great movie, it isn\'t without its flaws.  Hearing John\'s pre-pubescent voice cracking almost made me turn it off, and I know I found a couple of (small) problems while I was watching, but I couldn\'t remember them by the end of the movie, so they\'re clearly not that important.  I may have been a bad foley sound on a weapon, and probably something that the T-800 that didn\'t seem robo-talk enough.\r\n\r\nI honestly don\'t know who isn\'t going to like this movie:  it even has a low kill count.', ""So, it is time to review the last good Terminator movie.\r\n\r\nWhen T3 came out, I swear that people forgot it was even released... but at least it felt like it belonged in the Terminator franchise.\r\n\r\nWhen Salvation dropped, it felt like it fit as well, but it was an MCG film, so it also felt like Terminator meets Mickey Mouse.\r\n\r\nAnd when Terminator Typo was released, it kind of did it's best to completely alienate all the fans that the franchise had developed over the years.\r\n\r\nBut this one, well, this one actually was great. The Robert Patrick T-1000 liquid metal thing looked amazing, Patrick acted ominous and frightening, and seemed like a legit threat despite the size difference between he and Arnold.\r\n\r\nAnd in the process the T-1000 managed to produce some truly creepy visuals.\r\n\r\nAnd this John Connor, Edward Furlong, was absolutely amazing. You really got the sense from him that he could be the man that leads the rebellion in the future.\r\n\r\nAnd, Sarah Connor was buff, and upped her game as the heroine that could do, well, actually do the action she was required to preform. And not only that she was creepy and obsessed as well. She looked and acted like the kind of survivalist that would train the future savior of the world.\r\n\r\nIt all came together as a brilliant move with old Arnold playing the good guy this time, and, though it was an obvious bank on his star power, they pulled it off so no one would care. Right down to the first meeting where John didn't know if he could be trusted or not.\r\n\r\nIt was a fantastic story with fantastic visuals, and it all made of a stellar and entertaining watch."", ""Behold what we like to call the Greatest Action Movie Ever Made, and for good reason. For me this sits without a doubt as one of the best movies (and movie sequels) I've ever seen.

They have sent a new, improved, ""T1000"" (Robert Patrick) back in time to throttle him. Luckily, his future self has had the presence of mind to send one of the original models (Arnold Schwarzenegger) back on protection detail. As the devastation mounts and the bodies pile up, the young man convinces his protector to get his mother out of her secure institution - the authorities weren\'t convinced about her stories of futuristic ""terminator"" robots after last time - and also, to stop routinely killing people! It took James Cameron quite a while to put this sequel together, and it is almost as good as the original. Loads of action, some great visual and pyrotechnic effects as well as some quite engaging comedy moments that allow the story to deliver a surprising amount of characterisation for an action movie. You do feel just the tiniest bit invested in them, and though I did find the denouement dragged out just a little, it\'s a solidly entertaining piece of big screen cinema that allows a man who really cannot act to own the screen. Great fun.', '""_I need your clothes, your boots and your motorcycle._""\r\n\r\nJust when you think the first one was great, this masterpiece shows up. Everything gets amped up in a good way.

Its plot combines three strands that lead inevitably to this doomsday. In the first, an Air Force base commander (Sterling Hayden) goes insane and launches the go-code for his B52s to drop the bomb on their targets in Russia, while a British captain on an officer exchange program (Peter Sellers) tries to reason with him. In the second strand, we see the crew of a B52 commanded by the cowboyish Major Kong (Slim Pickens) as they prepare to drop the bomb. Finally, there are the scenes from the Pentagon war room, where the American president (again Peter Sellers) harangues a general (George&nbsp;C. Scott) about how this could have happened, until the mysterious German scientist Dr.&nbsp;Strangelove (Peter Sellers yet again) offers a solution.\r\n\r\nOriginally meant to be a straightforward adaptation of a political thriller novel, <i>Dr.&nbsp;Strangelove</i> became a madcap comedy. The characters' sexual quirks, anti-Communist hysteria and nonchalance about the coming apocalypse and are exaggerated to the point of farce. No other Peter Sellers film shows off his range of talents so well: he segues effortlessly between Captain Mandrake, a nervous fellow with a British accident already antiquated at the time the film was made, the staid American politician President Merkin Muffley, and Dr. Strangelove, one of the Nazi scientists that the USA brought over after World War&nbsp;II.\r\n\r\nFilmgoers must have perceived this film somewhat differently, when the threat of nuclear annihilation felt very real. Contemporary audiences won't fully get how black this black comedy is. Nonetheless, this film remains perennially funny, and even after numerous viewings over the last 15 years or so I still laugh every time."", 'A U.S. bomber plane is heading for Russia.  Communications are unavailable.  The Commie Russians have built a doomsday device.  And, according to crazy, (wheelchair-bound?), ex-Nazi scientist, Dr. Strangelove, nuclear destruction is upon us all!  Thanks to this eccentric comedy, I now have considerable respect for the talent of Peter Sellers.  How he pulled off three totally different roles so convincingly is just beyond me.  Especially his portrayal of the U.S. President; I could hardly believe that British Peter Sellers could do an American accent that naturally.  This was apparently a very black comedy for its time, as the threat of nuclear war was really a thing when this was filmed.  Offbeat, humorous script includes some eyebrow-raising, edgy dialogue and scenes.\r\n\r\nWould I recommend?  Yes, to those with a open mind, or a taste for a truly bizarre kind of comedy.', ""**Sex and war in an extremely sarcastic and intelligent film.**\r\n\r\nThis film is one of the best of director Stanley Kubrick's career, and is also one of the most iconic and acidic satire that cinema has ever seen. Inspired by a tense novel that was published in the same period, and by the political and military events that were taking place at the time, the film shoots in all directions to give us the most absurd and ridiculous image of the rivalry between the USA and the Soviet Union. Despite everything, and all the points in favor, I don't think this film is a true comedy. To me, honestly, it didn't make me laugh, although I absorb and understand the acidic irony that is here.\r\n\r\nThe script begins with a very serious incident that could be true (and the US even reviewed its military strategies in order to prevent something similar from happening in real life): after inventing, in his troubled mind, a crazy conspiracy theory according to which the Soviets are poisoning American drinking water, a crazed general initiates a pre-orchestrated military protocol designed to retaliate against a Russian attack with the full force of their nuclear arsenal. But with one detail: there was no Russian attack, which would make the Americans the aggressor country, and responsible for a holocaust of biblical proportions. Informed of this, the president meets with his generals and, in direct articulation with the Kremlin, tries by all means to prevent the worst.\r\n\r\nWhat's extraordinary about this film is the way it ridicules the sexual arousal that several characters have around nuclear war. For these characters, the end of the world, total war, is an absolute fetish, portrayed in almost erotic detail. The most obvious cases are Generals Ripper and Turgidson: each, in his own way, vehemently expressing the mental connection they make between sex and war. Whether by the way they speak and express themselves, or more implicitly, by holding phallic elements that are increasingly evident, they are men who are horny in war. In the same line of thought, the commander of the American aircraft, who becomes a cowboy on horseback in the bomb, as if this were an extension of his male phallus. And what about the character of Strangelove? His name says it all! He is a Nazi scientist in the service of the Americans, and the way he tries to contain his excitement in anticipation of the end of the world is evident, for example, in the idea he suggests of a bunker where the survivors, handpicked (the Nazi idea of the eugenics is very present here), would spend their time having sex to save the human race.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the great films in the career of Peter Sellers, a British actor who is famous for comedy. I've seen several of his films, and I already know his ability to play more than one character in the same film. Here, he gives life to three of the main characters, always with the same quality and professionalism. He is so good that it was really difficult to recognize the actor. George C. Scott and Sterling Hayden are also to be congratulated for the work they did in this film, which was certainly one of the ones that most immortalized them as actors.\r\n\r\nThe best technical aspect of the film is the cinematography. Kubrick used various techniques to convey his erotic-military message, such as the opening credits, where an in-flight refueling becomes a symbolic copulation. The camera framing was also thought out in detail, with strategically placed close-up scenes, some characters very well highlighted and others reduced to the smallest expression of themselves (the American president, who is portrayed as incompetent, like his army is able to control). The film is a true lesson in black-and-white cinematography. The sets and costumes are also excellent, and the attack on the air base is one of the best and most realistic combat scenes I've seen in a modern war film. The soundtrack, finally, is one of the most ironic there is, and it perfectly matches the tone of the film. Highlight, of course, for the opening and ending themes."", 'Just as ""Seven Days in May"" was hitting our screens, Stanley Kubrick used a superbly over-the-top effort from Sterling Hayden to depict a rogue general who has decided to use all the checks and balances in place to defend the United States to his own mischievous advantage and launch a pre-emptive bombing campaign on those pesky ""Ruskies"". It\'s only his perfectly moustachioed British executive officer ""Mandrake"" (Peter Sellers) who smells a rat, but he is on lockdown in their air force base that is, indeed, being besieged - but not by the ""Reds"". Meantime, the American President (also Sellers) is only just finding out that he\'s about to start a nuclear war and nobody knows quite how to top it - not even his chief of staff ""Turgidson"" (George C. Scott). A call to his opposite number in the Kremlin reveals that the Soviets haven\'t been letting the grass grow, and that they have their own shield - and one that\'s use would make the effects of the Hiroshima bomb look like a damp squib. With all this mistrust and mayhem abounding, is it going to be possible to avert the destruction of humanity? Sellers has multiple parts and carries them out effectively, but it\'s the support from Hayden, Scott and the gung-ho, yee-ha, merchant ""Maj. Kong"" (Slim Pickens) - in charge of the heavily laden bomber that is likely to stat the conflagration, that demonstrate really entertainingly not just the faults in the whole principle of a paranoia-driven command and control structure, but also of the flaws of human nature when it comes to increasing reliance on technology and automation. The calculating eponymous character, who could have come straight out of a ""Bond"" movie, also quite cleverly points to the provenance of so many of the scientists who supported the West\'s military programming whilst their historical loyalties were dubious at best. It\'s only ninety-odd minutes, but packs plenty to think and laugh about as the ridiculousness and seriousness of the scenario are presented satirically and potently, at a time when the cold war was warmer.']"

The prosecutor, ""de Villefort"" (Laurent Lafitte) appears sympathetic and accepts his pleas of innocence, but when his close friend ""Morcef"" (Bastien Bouillon) is called upon to vouch for ""Dantès"" his own envious agenda takes hold and next, our naive young seaman is heading to the solitude of the Chateau D\'If from which prisoners never escape. As the years of relentless frustration and boredom go by, his only conversation is a regular call from his jailers to see if he\'s still alive. Then a miracle occurs. Another prisoner has been tunnelling for years and inadvertently breaks through to his cell. It\'s this man - the Abbé Faria (Pierfrancesco Favino) - who gives him more than a little education as they try to dig their way to the sea wall. It\'s not to be for both, though, but armed with a knowledge that could change his life for ever, he manages to trick the guards and make it to land. It\'s now that the story of revenge hots up as we jump forward a few years and are introduced to the eponymous Count. He travels in style, has great wealth and style and is determined to avenge himself on the three men who framed him. As with himself, these men have gone on to great things with his denouncing friend now married to his love, ""Danglars"" owning a great trading fleet and the prosecutor now a powerful state official. ""Dantès"" has used his time well, assembling some allies whose roles in this unfolding drama are gradually revealed to us as politics, greed and jealousy stride to the fore of this classically designed production. The lavish costumes, stately homes and opulence of their lives contrasts well with the poverty and ruin faced by those collaterally damaged by the ambitions of men who cared but for themselves, and for whom our dashing and calculation gazillionaire is gunning. Nimey (who occasionally looked a bit like Kevin Kline here?) delivers that wronged and now Machiavellian characterisation especially well. There are also strong efforts from the younger characters ""Albert"" (Vassili Schneider); ""André"" (Julien De Saint Jean) and ""Haydée"" (Anamaria Vartolomei). It\'s essentially a thoroughly potent story of revenge, but it\'s as much about just how that can become a toxic influence that can eat into a man\'s soul and the challenge for ""Dantès"" and those around him whom he loves - however unwillingly on the surface - is not to become an obsessed demon every bit as ghastly as those he wishes to punish. It\'s this slow, dripping, evolution that the film delivers enthrallingly as we see this troubled man tread an increasingly conflicted line between love and hate. Revenge is said to be a dish best served cold, but like most things served cold - it doesn\'t keep for long.', ""The 2024 reimagining of The Count of Monte Cristo is a cinematic triumph, setting a new benchmark for adaptations of the beloved Dumas classic. Directed by Jacques Bernard, this latest French interpretation is nothing short of spellbinding, with Pierre Niney delivering a portrayal of Edmond Dantès that feels both deeply authentic and timeless. From Dantès’ naive beginnings to his calculated, unrelenting vengeance, Niney embodies the role with a level of intensity and depth that captivates from the very first scene.\r\n\r\nVisually, the film is breathtaking. The cinematography paints each setting—from the claustrophobic depths of Château d'If to the grandeur of Parisian society—in vivid, atmospheric detail. Every shot feels like a piece of art, masterfully capturing both the story’s drama and its rich historical backdrop. The film’s use of real locations transports viewers to the story’s world, making each moment feel hauntingly real, a rare achievement in period cinema.\r\n\r\nAdding to the experience is a lush, evocative score that amplifies the film’s emotional power. The music captures Dantès' inner turmoil and triumph with remarkable sensitivity, lending every high-stakes scene an added layer of tension. It’s a soundtrack that will stay with you long after leaving the theater, a perfect companion to Dumas' tale of betrayal and redemption.\r\n\r\nThe film’s costumes, masks, and makeup are absolutely spectacular. Every detail—whether the intricate designs of Dantès' masquerade attire or the worn expressions on characters weathered by hardship—feels perfectly tailored to the time period. The masks, in particular, add an air of intrigue, shrouding key characters in mystery and creating a rich visual metaphor for the story’s themes of deception and disguise.\r\n\r\nAt a generous three hours, The Count of Monte Cristo thoroughly explores Dantès' journey, though I found myself wishing it were even longer. An adaptation of this depth and quality could have easily been extended to a two-part epic, much like last year’s exquisite French rendition of The Three Musketeers, with an expanded runtime of four or five hours to fully savor each intricate turn of Dantès' revenge.\r\n\r\nIn every respect, this 2024 version is a masterpiece and, without a doubt, the definitive Monte Cristo for a modern audience. It balances faithfulness to Dumas' original with bold, cinematic flair, capturing the story's essence in a way that is grand, poignant, and unforgettable. This is a film that will surely stand the test of time.""]"

This is an impeccably detailed, beautifully acted, refined drama with a strong feminist angle that’s as stirring as it is thought-provoking.\r\n\r\nMarianne (Noémie Merlant) is commissioned to paint the wedding portrait of Héloïse (Adèle Haenel), a young woman who has just left the convent. Because Héloïse is a very reluctant bride-to-be, Marianne arrives under the guise of companionship, observing the smallest of details about the woman by day and secretly painting her by firelight at night. As the two women spend their days with one another, intimacy and attraction grow, and the portrait becomes a symbol of the intensity of their love.\r\n\r\nThe lead performances are mannered and structured in the most effective way. The strong desire between the two women is manifested in a gaze or careful examination of a wisp of hair or the way Héloïse crosses her hands. There’s a quiet intensity to the emotional and physical intimacy between these two women, making this love story’s end feel all the more heartbreaking.\r\n\r\nThis is mostly an all-female film, and the men briefly seen on screen play little importance. Rounding out the characters are Héloïse’s mother (Valeria Golino) and housekeeper Sophie (Luàna Bajrami), who both fill critical roles in the story as the film explores issues affecting women at the time, including arranged marriages, career expectations, and health concerns.\r\n\r\nThe film itself is absolutely stunning, with gorgeously romantic and lush cinematography by Claire Mathon setting a sensual tone that complements the story. The artistry is outstanding, making “Portrait of a Lady on Fire” one of the most powerful, intellectual dramas of the year.', 'Undoubtedly worth a watch; who knew portraits were the Tinder of the 1700s.', 'Full review: <a>https://www.tinakakadelis.com/beyond-the-cinerama-dome/2021/12/28/paint-me-like-one-of-your-french-girls-portrait-of-a-lady-on-fire-review<a>\r\n\r\nCeline Sciamma’s fourth feature film, _Portrait of a Lady on Fire_, is a triumph. Few romance movies capture the totality of love, loss, and remembrance in the way Sciamma does in this film. The story is simple: Marianne (Noémie Merlant) has been hired to paint a portrait of Heloise (Adèle Haenel) to be sent to the Milanese nobleman she is to marry. He will not marry her until he sees what she looks like. Other artists have tried and failed to paint Heloise, but she has resisted because she doesn’t want to be married. Marianne pretends to be Heloise’s walking companion, all the while studying Heloise so she can paint her in secret. Eventually, though, Marianne’s secret is revealed and Heloise agrees to sit for her.']"

He was one of the finest at getting straight through the bullshit and to the heart of all things noir (as the immortal Jean-Luc Godard stated, 'All I need to make a film is a man, a girl and a gun'). \r\n\r\nBarbara Stanwyck is one of my favourite actresses of the period, and is a classic 'femme fatale'. I've never been a huge fan of Fred MacMurray, but his 'nice guy' persona is used to sheer advantage by Wilder, and he end up both doing his finest work for Wilder (here and in 'The Apartment') and being the ultimate noir male protagonist. Interestingly, one of my favourite actors, Edward G. Robinson, thought so much of the script that he opted out of his demand of never doing a supporting role. Many people admire Wilder the director, but as a writer (or co-writer) he's just as cinematically important and influential.\r\n\r\nLike any other film of his, at least that I've had the pleasure to see, it's worth a purchase and re-watches. The dialogue, especially, is simply fantastic. I'd take just one of his early works over a hundred of the films Hollywood churns out nowadays. They're simply that better and intrinsically satisfying. Immortal cinema."", ""A banner movie from film noir's classic era.\r\n\r\nDouble Indemnity is directed by Billy Wilder and Wilder co-adapts the screenplay with Raymond Chandler from the novella written by James M. Cain. It stars Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck and Edward G. Robinson. Music is by Miklos Rozsa and cinematography by John F. Seitz.\r\n\r\nFor a film lover such as myself it feels redundant writing a review for Double Indemnity, because quite simply there's nothing to say that hasn't been said already. The esteem it is held in is justified, it's a razor sharp noir across the board and can be put up as one of the classic noir era pictures that got lovers of the form interested in the first place.\r\n\r\nBased around the infamous Snyder/Gray case of 1927, Wilder and Chandler fill the story with a sinister cynicism that is palpable in the extreme. With a script positively pumped with hard boiled dialogue, a simple case of murder becomes so much more, a labyrinth of devious cunning and foolishness, with a trio of top performances crowning this topper.\r\n\r\nTechnically via aural and visual work the story gains extra spice. Rosza provides a score that frays the nerves, imbuing the sense of doom and edginess required for plotting. Seitz excels, the photography a trademark for noir, heavy shadows, abrupt camera angles and menacing shards of light come to the fore.\r\n\r\nAnd to top it all off, it gets away with so much, a real censorship baiter. The story takes a journey to the dark side of morality, and the makers, bless them for they know what they do, gleefully tease the production code to give film noir fans a reason to rejoice.\r\n\r\nQuintessential stuff. 10/10"", ""Perhaps the single best example of a film noir movie, _Double Indemnity_ (1944), stars Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck, and Edward G. Robinson. Based on a novel written by James Cain, the screenplay was co-written by Billy Wilder and the amazing Raymond Chandler.\r\n\r\nSet in 1938 California, the story is based on the true-life 1927 murder of a married Queens, New York woman's husband who was killed by the woman's boyfriend after she took out a large insurance policy that contained a double-indemnity clause. In this movie, Phyllis Dietrichson (played by Stanwyck) takes out a life insurance policy on her husband with the help of insurance salesman-soon-to-be-turned-murderer Walter Neff (played by MacMurray). Robinson plays Barton Keyes, Neff's co-worker and a very suspicious claims adjuster who suspects Phyllis Dietrichson might have had something to do with her husband's sudden death.\r\n\r\nThis movie is an hour and forty-seven minutes of pure movie love. The film was nominated for seven Academy Awards [Best Picture, Best Actress in a Leading Role (Barbara Stanwyck), Best Director, Best Writing-Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Sound Recording, and Best Music (Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture)], though it won none."", ""Very well done film noir from the 1940s with great performances by Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck and Edward G. Robinson along with good photography and direction from Billy Wilder. I've seen this one before but it's been at least 20 years though coincidentally, a scene from this was in a movie I recently watched (another re-watch) in Femme Fatale. **4.5/5**"", 'So poor old Tom Powers is married to the cold and calculating ""Phyllis"" (Barbara Stanwyck). When she starts to have an affair with his charismatic insurance broker ""Walter"" (Fred MacMurray) the two alight on a cunning plan to dispose of him and to claim the life insurance money. Being in the know about these things, ""Walter"" figures out a way in which they can double the payout. With their hands still rubbing together, the man\'s body is found on a railway track and when the police believe it accidental, the cash rolls in. All looks good until one of his colleagues ""Keyes"" (Edward G. Robinson) smells a rat - and he starts to stick his very sensitive nose in. I always felt Barbara Stanwyck was a very under-rated actress - she is terrific here, as is the under-stated Robinson. Even the usually unremarkable MacMurray turns in an strong performance as Billy Wilder, with some great intense photography and wonderfully potent dialogue pulls the threads of this clever and menacing drama together. The always reliable Miklós Rósza creates a score that really works well with the accumulating tension as we head towards a denouement that keeps us on our toes right til the end. This is a great film.', '**A magnificent ""noir"" with great actors, which was unlucky at the awards, and was immortalized by the public, surviving fresh to this day.**\r\n\r\nI\'ve previously had the opportunity to mention that I really like noir films, and this is another one that I had the pleasure of seeing and will save for occasional rewatches. Based on a good detective novel, the film is extremely intelligent, dark and well articulated. Made in 1944, still during the Second World War, it was nominated the following year for seven Oscars (Best Film, Best Director, Best Actress, Best Screenplay, Best Sound, Best Black-and-White Cinematography and Best Original Soundtrack for Comedy or Drama). I naturally wasn\'t alive at the time, but I imagine it was one of the favorite films at that year\'s awards gala. Interestingly, and not without injustice, it lost them all.\r\n\r\nDirected in a very intelligent and effective way by Billy Wilder (who was one of the great directors of Hollywood\'s golden era), the film has excellent cinematography, with magnificent clarity and play of light that takes advantage of the sun, shutters and other forms of soften the brightness when necessary. The soundtrack, by Miklós Rózsa, is very well-used and atmospheric. The script is excellent and was based on a very good dramatic story: an insurance agent is seduced by a woman and then tricked into helping her kill her husband and receive the money from a huge accident insurance policy. It turns out that insurance companies can be more meticulous than the police and, while the authorities are satisfied with an “accident”, some elements of the company are not uninterested in the matter. Could it have been better? Perhaps if the man\'s death was more nebulous and the perpetrator was not evident.\r\n\r\nFred MacMurray had, in this film, the opportunity to give the greatest performance of his entire film career. Despite being a good actor and having participated in more projects, it was this film that immortalized him and meant that his name did not disappear completely. It\'s not a perfect performance, the actor is a little too theatrical at times, but it worked great. The role of the femme fatale was masterfully played by Barbara Stanwick, another great actress who deserves applause for the work developed here. In addition to being very beautiful, she gave the character an aura of perfidy and callousness, and had an exceptional rapport with MacMurray, full of tension and restrained desire. Despite being away from the spotlight, the secondary cast does a competent job: the efforts of Edward G. Robinson and Jean Heather deserve to be highlighted.']"

It\'s amazing set design, brilliant cinematography, groundbreaking special effects and futuristic story truly makes it one of the must-sees in cinema! \r\n\r\nIt is set in the future, in a city called Metropolis where the citizens are divided into two groups: workers (who live under the ground and are working 10 hour shifts by enormous machines that keeps Metropolis working) and the royals (living in luxury in the great city on the surfice). And over them all, is the creator of Metropolis: Joh Fredersen (Alfred Abel). His son Freder (Gustav Fröhlich) falls in love with a woman of the working-class called Maria (Brigitte Helm) who preaches that a mediator will come and create peace and equality for both workers and royals. Joh Fredersen sees Maria as a big threat agains his ""order"", so he and the inventor Rotwang (Rudolf Klein-Rogge) kidnaps her and copies her appearence onto a robot, which will destroy the workers faith in Maria. However, Rotwang secretly plans to programme the robot to make the workers destroy the city and crush Joh Fredersen, as an act of vengeance against Fredersen for a sin he committed in the past...\r\n\r\nLang made this film in 1927, and it was a huge blockbuster event of that year. However, after the premiere, the US distributor heavily cut down the film, and thereafter the original version was considered lost for almost a decade. In 2008 they found the original version in Argentina (very damaged, but watchable), which became the basis for the most recent reconstruction (2010). If you are going to watch this movie (as I highly recommend that you do!) that\'s the version to watch!\r\n\r\nOverall, Metropolis is a REALLY REALLY great movie, that you, once again, MUST watch!\r\n\r\nI give it a 10/10', 'This has got to be the ultimate cinematic illustration of the strata of human existence. Whether it be a story of the survival of the fittest; the cleverest; the most devious; most beautiful - or a hybrid of some/all - it reflects poignantly how humanity always seeks to exist within a hierarchical structure (merited or otherwise, but perfectly epitomised here by the matriarchal, deific robot), but how much more effectively mankind can succeed if it accepts and values everyone and works together. It also clearly identifies the perennial problem of those with the brain always ending up far more successful, comfortable - and powerful than those who do the labour. Hence, this wonderful tale from Fritz Lang takes us to ""Metropolis"" - a totalitarian - though not necessarily intentionally malevolent - society, in which everyone has their place and role. Except, that is - for the son of the ""Master"". Like many a fickle youth; he has little to occupy his time and his meaningless existence leaves him ripe for new ideas. When he takes pity on a recently sacked employee of his father and shortly afterwards is exposed to a lifestyle he couldn\'t even have imagined, the story starts to gain a thought-provoking and unstoppable pace. The score magnificently guides us from the drudgery of day-to-day-life through the emancipating revolution that inevitably follows, with all of the ill-foreseen, largely devastating consequences - like a bottle of champagne that has been shaken, sooner or later the cork pops! It is also a story of love between the son and a woman way, way, way beneath his station. Yes, there is light on the sunlit uplands - and much like a forest fire that destroys all in it\'s path; this film clearly suggests at the end that hope and optimism will triumph and a green shoots of recovery starts to grow again... It also, as a piece of cinema, is clearly the inspiration for so many directors, cinematographers and story tellers that followed...']"

I don’t think it’s hyperbole to call the first 10 minutes a blood orgy – I mean, a waterfall ends up literally flowing red with the blood of the dead.

Pray for the best, but prepare for the worst. \r\n\r\nPrisoners is directed by Denis Villeneuve and written by Aaron Guzikowski. It stars Hugh Jackman, Jake Gyllenhaal, Viola Davis, Terence Howard, Maria Bello, Melissa Leo and Paul Dano. Music is by  Jóhann Jóhannsson and cinematography by Roger Deakins.\r\n\r\nWhen Keller Dover's (Jackman) daughter and her friend go missing, he takes matters into his own hands...\r\n\r\nAt first glance of the plot synopis, one could be forgiven for thinking this is yet another revenge thriller filled out by police procedural side-bars. How pleasant to find that Prisoners has more to offer than a simple who is the criminal? And just how far will a vengeful father go to satiate his grief?.\r\n\r\nPrisoners is such an apt title because all the main players here are trapped by either mental fragility or victims of their innocence, guilt or chaotic impulses. It's a multi stranded character piece that poses many questions, while of course it has a big mystery element. The narrative features a whole host of clues that might be something, or not, unanswered questions dangle throughout until the finale reveals thge edgy secrets.\r\n\r\nIt's safe to say that the themes at work here are dark and upsetting, with the core abduction thread siddling up against horredous back stories, torture and religious mania. Gruzikowski's screenplay is quality, mesmerising even, there's no lazy filler or extranous sequences, even as the jigsaw pieces are put together in the last quarter, you may find yourself wondering how you missed something so simple?.\r\n\r\nThis was Villeneuve's first English language picture, and it's not hard to see why he was highly touted as one of the next big director beings - his output that followed subsequently bears this out. His control of mood and pacing is superb, his garnering of high quality perfs from his cast (notably Jackman and Gyllenhaal) is impressive, and his teaming with the great Deakins is a match made in photographic heaven.\r\n\r\nThis is adult film making, a thriller designed to illicit emotional responses from the audience. Relentless and powerful, a troubling examination of the human conditioning in various guises - and we are witnesses. 9/10"", ""**This heavy film is not for everyone but for those that enjoy suspenseful crime cinema, this is one of the absolute best.**\r\n\r\nA crime thriller that brilliantly manages its slow pace to create the same dread the characters feel in the hearts of the audience. Every passing second steals the parents' hope away that they could ever find their children alive. Everything about this movie emphasizes the story's emotion, from the acting and muted color tones to the sets and directing."", ""Prisoners is a carefully constructed labyrinth, deceptively simple and very clever. The material was nothing new even when the film was released, but director Denis Villeneuve (pre-Dune) and screenwriter Aaron Guzikowski work a few unexpected twists and turns into their maze to keep us on our toes. The key element, however, is Hugh Jackman’s career-best performance as Keller Dover, a father whose patience for police work quickly runs thin when Detective Loki (the always effective Jake Gyllenhaal) fails to find Dover’s kidnapped little daughter.\r\n\r\nIt will surprise no one that Dover decides to take the law into his own hands, recruiting Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard), his best friend whose daughter has also gone missing, to kidnap the only suspect – whom the police has ruled out for the moment –, take him to an abandoned house, and beat a confession out of him. This is par for the course in the movies, but is it realistic? Can a father, however desperate he may be, really go from zero to psycho in no time flat?\r\n\r\nThe film makes this transition 50% more believable by making the character a committed survivalist, meaning that he was halfway there all along. And even if we still found it hard to believe, Jackman would just browbeat us into believing it with a sadistic, ballistic, animalistic skin-shedding, raw nerve-baring performance wherein he doesn't just go berserk; he goes full on Beserker.\r\n\r\nIn some twisted way, all this makes sense; the antagonist or antagonists are just as crazy as Dover, if not more: making children disappear is their way of “making war with God”. With that in mind, who better than a monster to find a monster? Dover may not in fact be too far off either, or is he? In one of those twists I mentioned, the movie toys with the Law of Economy of Characters by casting Paul Dano as the mentally challenged man on whom Dover’s suspicions (and fists, among other objects) fall.\r\n\r\nGyllenhaal’s work is as strong Jackman’s, but more subtle and nuanced; he gives his Loki an eye tic which lets us know that, although he has solved all his cases, and belying his usual calm and collected demeanor, he has not gotten to where he is without some traumas of his own."", 'Prisoners is a largely generic revenge / suspense / mystery ""they have my kid"" tale with a predictable plot that gives itself away too early. No attempt at realism, this is Scooby-Doo style investigation - lie detectors are treated seriously, ""bad guys"" are largely 1-dimensional with poorly explained motives designed to surprise rather than give insight, etc.\r\n\r\nIt tries to make up for this in a few ways: a) bump up the intensity of scenes (comes across forced and awkward), b) add extra violence and dark semi-religious symbolism (seems out of place and largely meaningless), and most importantly c) maintain an air of mystery by throwing left-field plot points at you every 3-5 minutes to keep your attention. \r\n\r\nIf you carefully note the clues, about half way through the film it strongly indicates the finale. After that the air of mystery that keeps the film feeling suspenseful largely dissolves and you are left with what feels like a AI-generated script desperately trying and failing to throw you off the initial clues.\r\n\r\nThe film\'s greatest redeeming quality is its attempt to turn some revenge film character archetypes on their head. It is not always successful, but the attempt to break cliches is always welcome! I suspect a much better film will be inspired by this.']"

He turns up in a Texan clinic dressed in a striped suit, but recalling little for the slightly roguish doctor who helps him after some dehydrating time in the desert to use to help identify him. A tiny scrap of paper in his wallet enables him to, though, and soon ""Walt"" (Dean Stockwell) arrives to try and get his long-lost brother back to his own home in Los Angeles. As the story now gradually unfolds, we discover that ""Travis"" has a son who lives with ""Walt"" but we are unsure as to just what has led him to his current, absent-minded, predicament. Unwilling to fly, the two take the long road trip back getting to know each other and slowly building a renewed sense of trust before he is to be re-introduced to the son (Hunter Carson) he hasn\'t seen for four years and who requires some answers of his own. The last half hour brings the threads together neatly, if a little conveniently, allowing a few brief appearances from Nastassja Kinski that brings the story of ""Travis"" and his trauma full circle. To be honest, I found the actual plot rather weak, indeed the story isn\'t up to much at all really - it\'s the performance from HDS that is measured and engaging. His flawed character gradually comes out of his self-induced shell as it seems he is learning about himself almost at the same pace as we are - and that makes the film compelling for the most part. It\'s a story that takes it\'s time, and watching it I found it did take me a few minutes to get myself into a suitably low gear to appreciate it. It\'s isn\'t a plod, or a slow watch - it is a nuanced, occasionally amusing, search for identity - oh, and for a field in Paris, Texas!', ""**A film full of qualities, but which will not please the general public.**\r\n\r\nThere are films that are made for commercial audiences and others that are clearly made to please specialized critics and film theorists. Although this film was present on the commercial circuit, the truth is that Wim Wenders directed this film for critics and film festival audiences, and this explains why critics love it and why the general public hardly knows this work. . About me? To be quite honest, I didn't particularly like the film, and it's not the kind of film I like to watch or watch with pleasure. However, I am the first to recognize that it is a work full of artistic and technical qualities, and that it deserves a close look by any student and fan of the seventh art.\r\n\r\nThe plot revolves around a man who spent four years wandering through desert areas of Texas due to a huge psychological shock. We don't know what he suffered, but it is obvious that he is not well when he is finally rescued by his brother, and he spends a long time without saying a word, just trying to resume his march to nowhere. As the plot develops, we understand the emotional void he feels and desperately seeks to fill. The reunion with his son, whom he hadn't seen for years, will mark the beginning of a journey of inner healing, of reuniting with himself and the hurts of his past. The idea of family, the crisis of moral and social values, the role of men and women in marriage and the absence of feelings are themes that the film, very discreetly, addresses throughout the story it tells us.\r\n\r\nAnyone who wants to see this film should prepare themselves for a long, very visual experience: the film is a grueling two and a half hours long and the action is quite slow. Wenders, who even thought about becoming a painter, likes to work very carefully on the visual and pictorial side of his films, and the slow action allows him, in this specific case, to explore to the maximum the visual beauty of desert scenes or urban landscapes. of Texas, where the action is concentrated. Do I need to say that the choice of sets and filming locations was one of the aspects that I liked most? Thanks to a good cinematography job, each one looks even more beautiful, wild and rude. Harmonizing perfectly with all this, the soundtrack, on guitar, plays a little with the Wild West and with the melodies that we usually associate with the Western style.\r\n\r\nIn addition to a very well done and solid plot, and good visual and technical values, the film also features the extraordinary work of Harry Dean Stanton. The actor has never been one of those stars that draws crowds, but he has quality and gives us here, probably, the best work of his film career. He is solid and impactful enough to capture our full attention with a minimum of words and facial expressions, and he doesn't say a word or change his facial expression during the first half hour of the film. The film also has excellent contributions from Dean Stockwell and Nastassja Kinski, and even young Hunter Carson does a well-done job. However, the stage is all Stanton's.""]"

This is a glorious film to look at. The photography is dark, gloomy and hugely effective at eliciting a feeling of sorrow for the children as they struggle to survive in their new lives. There are glimmers of optimism, but Kenji Mizoguchi manages our expectations well. There is no yellow brick road here, the sunlit uplands are definitely there but we have no idea when (or if) one or other or neither of the children may ever reach them. The acting is poised and characterful - especially the young ""Anju"" (Kyôko Kagawa) who tries to look out for her initially weak and vulnerable younger brother ""Zushio"" (Yoshiaki Hanayagi). It is beautifully scored with a mixture of Japanese and classical themes that compliment well the contrasting images of poverty, wealth, cruelty and kindness of this story of barbarity and revenge. The cinematography does benefit from a big screen - it makes the story and the imagery all the more impactful, but even on a television this is is two hours that truly keeps you gripped.']"
